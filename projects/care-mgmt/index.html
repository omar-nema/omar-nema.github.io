          <p>
            My experience in implementing and measuring clinical outcomes driven by this Care Management has sparked in an interest in using technology to shape social interactions. I have been able to channel this interest by instituting an empathetic design process, and developing a workflow automation engine that facilitates interactions between clinicians and patients.
            <br><br>
        Additionally, designing Care Management has sparked a deep personal interest in understanding how visual forms affect the way we process information and make decisions. I have explored this further in personal data visualization projects (Thought Parser and Referral Networks).

      <div class="block-text">
        <p class="block-subheader">Product Context</p>
        <p>
          For the past two years (2017 onwards), I have been leading design and development for Arcadia's Care Management product. Care Management was built to address a growing concern for incorporating social determinants of health into the care process. The product helps facilitate clinicians in addressing gaps in care that a physician does not typically provide: coordinating services, addressing social needs, and ensuring engagement with health interventions. he application guides clinicians through the process of identifying suitable patients to care for and creating a plan to address the patient's health concerns.
            <br><br>
          I designed the application interface (UX, visual, and product), reporting model, and workflow automation engine. I've also managed its implementation - both externally with care teams, and internally with the engineers executing on development. I work as a designer and product manager, with a team of three engineers executing on development. The product is currently used by eight large healthcare organizations (patient populations of roughly 500k) and continues to scale.

              <p class="block-subheader">Design Challenges</p>
              <p>When I first took ownership of the Care Management product at Arcadia, there was no formal design culture. No resources allocated to design work<span class="mobile-hide">. Additionally, I inherited a design process centered around incorporating feedback from leadership. Individual users were not given a voice.
              </span>
              </p>
              <p>
              However, the Care Management product that I was tasked with working on was workflow-heavy and collaborative, and called for thoughtful<span class="mobile-hide">, meticulous </span>design.
              </p>

              <p class="block-subheader">Empathy in Corporate Setting</p>
              <p>
                The design process that I instituted gradually shifted the focus away from leadership, and gave a voice to the clinicians using the product. To shift the power structure, I worked on first building trust with client leadership. I allocated spare development budget to features that directly respond to user feedback, and tracked outcomes. I illustrated how user feedback anticipated pain points and  resulted in productivity. Additionally, I worked with our Sales team to ensure that features contracted during the sales process are given additional budget (and do not interfere with existing priorities).
              </p>
              <p>
                Over time, I was able to shift the decision-making process to my own team, as opposed to executive leadership. Under my leadership, the design process has become much more empathetic, and user-centered. User research is built into our development cycle, and feeds into feature prioritization. Features are only built after a design and review cycle with users.

              <p class="block-subheader">Initial Design Process</p>
              <p>Given resource constraints, I introduced an accelerated user research and design process. I spent one week in 'listening' mode - shadowing and interviewing users. I then moved to a weekly meeting cadence with our pilot users, and shared progress as I moved through the process of creating low-fidelity, high-fidelity, and interactive prototypes.
              </p>
              <p>
                This process guided the development our first Care Management product release, and spurred a flurry of feedback.

              <p>
                The care management product scaled quickly after its initial launch despite our constraints in product & design resources.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to practice inclusive design at scale, I decentralized portions of the design process and asked account managers (who are not formally trained in design) to interview users on a regular basis. I continued to set up weekly touchpoints, and monthly on-site visits with users.

                Trends emerging from user feedback fed into the development of a style guide. In an effort to prevent clincian burnout, and cater to a wide range of technical capabilities, I developed a guide that is clear and simple.

          After observing the product in action for one year, it started to become clear that certain parts of the care management workflow are repetitive. We wanted to eliminate the repetitive, administrative, portions of the job, while still giving the user the flexibility they need to make clinical decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
          After a series of in-depth user interviews, I worked with Nick Stepro (VP of Product) to design, prototype, and build out a set of rules to automate repetitive tasks. I built out an initial MVP data model and stored procedure that Nick then expanded and fleshed out.
          <br><br>
          The ruleset is expansive, covering clinical indicators (conditions, risk factors), organizational structure, and workload balancing. We translated the rules to a functioning proof-of-concept (SQL data model and stored procedures), which my engineering colleagues fleshed out further. This automation engine has been perceived by the market as innovative, and has distinguished Arcadia's Care Management product from competitors. All eight clients have opted to incorporate this functionality into their workflow the first half of 2020. Below, a snapshot of the schema I initially developed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The resulting automation structure is powerful, and highly configurable. One example use case: accomodating a transition from an inpatient hospital visit to home. In realtime, our automation procedures look for any discharge event pulled into the Arcadia system. It then assigns a nurse to the case based on the user's attributed location. The engine will trigger a notification to the user, and schedule an assessment task (aimed at addressing the patient's needs). The assessment tasks will then trigger a series of 'care plan goals' for the care manager to work with the patient and address.

            Tracking performance is critical to directing an effective care management program. To meet this need, I designed and built a set of reporting tables (in SQL). The tables are intended to be used in a self-serve fashion, and include: workflow metrics, longitudinal outcomes reporting, and product usage. These reporting tables are used (by clinical analysts) to generate reports that guide clinical and business strategy.

            Below, a poster I developed with my colleague, Nick Stepro, showing program outcomes for one hospital system (I did the analysis, and Nick created the visual). We see a clear reduction in cost and inpatient stays across patients managed using our platform.
