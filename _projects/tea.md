time: 2014-2015
heading: Motivated by the challenge of improving an ingrained, ritualistic experience, I developed two product aimed at improving the tea experience. The first is a collaboration with Pawel Golyski, and the second I developed on my own.

        <p> Making tea is a technical process that is executed solely with intuition. Tea taste is dependent on steep time at a specific temperatures (which varies by type). With this project I aimed to.</p> 
        <ul> 
        <li>Maintain the soothing, ritualistic aspect of making tea</li>      
        <li>Reduce the margin of error in making the right cup of tea (control temp & steep time)</li>

        <p> While my first prototype was precise, and delivered tea exactly as programmed, my end product was far simpler. I shifted my focus to retaining the charm of tea-making ritual. The device operates on a relatively simple mechanism â€” loose leaf tea, or tea bag is placed into a mug (with boiling water). Rather than using the typical chain or wire to hold the tea infuser, the device uses a waterproof temperature sensor. 
        <br>
        The device simply signals when tea is ready to be placed & removed with a gentle blue light.

        <p>The electronics here do not interfere with the tea-making experience, the device resembles a standard tea-bag. The tea infuser sits on a stand in which the electronics are encased.

    My first prototype was: chunky and precise. Though it was incredibly effective at making a 'perfect' cup of tea - the device heats water to a specified temperature (device is equipped with temperature sensor), drops and removes tea bag (via servo motor) after a specified amount of time.
    <br>
    This device was 3D printer in (many) chunks, and was assembled through a simple pressfit. Servo motors, temperature sensors, and arduino were used to produce the mechanism.

    Testing the product in social gatherings was - well, a bit awkward. The machinery and design was distracting, and removed the charm of making tea.

    <p> In an effort to break down the emotional appeal of tea, I conducted interviews, sat in cafes, and continued my chronic consumption of tea. While some users expressed attachment to the tea-making ritual, others were concerned solely with the end product (a well-prepared cup of tea).
