<div>1/4</div>
<div>thoughts today (how i’m feeling to diary now)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>coldasfuck. public transport way back from work. the men, mustachioed, who always tries to incite conversation. not feeling it. hood on, scarf on face, physical barrier from conversation. on bus, reading.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>leaving the atocha station. a smooth but pleasant read so far.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work as path - work and meeting with banish about measures. room for improvement? um, none. process is pretty rigid and defined. scary and confining. but josh stevens moving to web so long-term path better?</div>
<div>when have i ever done things for the long-term path? </div>
<div>other things: measures team laid-back. no specific deadlines. code reviews. looks like position open within next 2 months.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>revisiting conversation in head about discomfort with talking about seeing new people, stef. resting on my ego, resting on my need for validation. siavash i think applying this to his life a bit too hard. as usual, our conversations highly vague and intellectualized. this conversation i think, could use that. that is, in addressing that i have negative thought patterns. in thinking: how do i deal with them? but really just needed someone to listen, offer some empathy and sympathy. intellectualizing whilst hurt is..draining?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today’s table topic with siavash: discussing meditation. benefits. potential downsides as well. the neutrality, lack of overwhelming emotion.</div>
<div>then moving into ‘knowing oneself’. outlining my theory for how people become themselves as result of arbitrary (or perhaps not arbitrary) but decisions to become a certain person.</div>
<div>slavish talking about how meditation can parse out desires driven by the image of oneself one strives to as a result of external pressure vs image of oneself one has built on personality/ambitions. (didn’t quite put it this way, but this is the qualifier i add). not sure you can parse it out this way.</div>
<div>this is something i’ve thought about a lot / intellectualized in vague spacey brain head. but have not really really delved into philosophy or reading about this. probably should.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>validation. whether it’s natural/logical to follow ‘refill model’ of confidence - that is, confidence energized by actual events, or more rational/advantageous to carry a baseline level of confidence. to what extent are my personality flaws anomalous?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>philosophy. art.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>meditate?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>deciding, when home from work: gym or not gym? and, with resolution in mind - just pick something &amp; do it. did it. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>1/7</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>dear omary,</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>how have you spent week?</div>
<div>2 days. work -&gt; data pulling for poster. 1 day -&gt; work, gym, reading, reflecting (solemnly, but clearly on past weekend).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>why is it hard to write personal personal vulnerable things in journal?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work taking a toll. today a no-coffee day (why? just decided) and v v tired (related? prob not). but tired emotionally - what am i doing here, in this company. and a bit like, unfocused</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking about - sucking at everything right now.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>siavash catching me off guard with the question: what are you thinking? mid imagining a conversation with may where i’m trying to explain visit to dc/convo with stef. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>queries running running running and waiting for data</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>finished work connector analysis (without error part). but doesn’t feel that rewarding. data feels..so simple. and showing to steve but no real wow. just like okay cool make something for the dashboard.</div>
<div>and in head, brainstorming dashboard. how in more positive state of mind i would be jumping jingling with ideas. but now not so much. </div>
<div>work. what is it. what am i doing with my life.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>compulsively checking phone for no reason. outlook, Facebook, occasional tinder and snap. go on date this weekend: goal?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>1/8</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Good chilling with Casey</div>
<div>But life sort of narrow</div>
<div>Nice nice chill zone. Explaining break over period of long time. Story broken up between shabazz, musings, joint, dates, music mixing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>1/9</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the day was.</div>
<div>spirits high. in the morning at least.</div>
<div>10ish. up and out, making pita butter. siavish up unusually early, joining.</div>
<div>morning of - online shopping. Skype for 2 hours with may and colin. actually nice / worked out. lots of love talk. not really great for anyone..</div>
<div>reading a bit. </div>
<div>groceries. cloudy bike ride to TJ. </div>
<div>bike exhilarating. </div>
<div>yahya in the house after. banter, joints, usual. this time accompanied with a wave of euphoria. </div>
<div>long long shower and dancing. yahya + siavash out to get ingredients for dinner. in the meantime - attempting to nap. descending into sexual fantasies. julia the main subject.</div>
<div>weed giving me tired/groggy comedowns. so quitting until neon indian (17 days).</div>
<div>resolve to go back to ultra healthy. </div>
<div>melancholy rest of night. julia over for dinner (restless in meantime). and it’s okay. are we eating with them? are we eating this? indecision making it hard to read into true wants, but intuition that julia wanted dinner separately, and healthier food. some cross-group jokes. staying over until like 9:30? so maybe 2 hours. felt a bit long really. </div>
<div>feeling down about the fact that chilling doesn’t last forever. that’s a dinner and done and that there’s a natural time for conversation and dinner to end. </div>
<div>in the room. well hanging with slavish and them shortly. then in the room, reading. messaging ruby on tinder.</div>
<div>out to saloon with engineers - emily, jenna, casey, guarav (and philip, musical friend). life and love life and funny stories (feel weird about retelling stories but guess everyone does that) and then out around midnight. read sleep.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>1/10</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>rain. brain: relatively sharp, in musing sort of way. good state of mind. rain dripping on windows. me, nestled in corner of couch. a bit cold. reading leaving the atocha station, in fragments - but not distractedly. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesteday - after describing my day to tinder girl - realizing that it was mundane but in some ways though-stirring - and receiving sarcastic reply of ‘woo what a day’..thinking of justifying what i’m doing to myself. like evaluating my day in terms of events. accomplishments. thought in different form: feeling bad for not wanting to socialize, etc. but this doesn’t make sense. pursuit of intellectual exploration, curiosity, does not manifest itself in the same ways. not always craving opinions and conversations of others. exploration now feels internal. exploring thoughts and ideas with detachment, without having to deal with platitudes, courtesy, considerateness, or - other people, really.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back in mode of getting things done. things like errands. ordering stuff. etc. interesting how this oscillates, how i can be so productive. other times - aware, but purposefully neglectful.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ben lerner / leaving the atocha : </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>drugs to make reality more available, rather than escape reality. hm.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the unfamiliarity (of spain / new place) making the experience more intellectual, meaningful. every object - even rock, is examined in much broader scale and context. familiarity reducing critical examination.</div>
<div>how is familiarity affecting my experience of boston?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ascension into fame can be made without really feeling accomplishment, feeling important. detached.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>theme of feeling detached from oneself, watching oneself. sort of melding with the poet - writing things on which to project language.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>retrospective analysis. thinking - this is what i may have been thinking.</div>
<div>awareness of contorting oneself, one’s values, and one’s narrative to fit into a social scene.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i never reflect on my imaginations, my fantasies.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>dev06</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>RESEARCH, DONT JUST THINK</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>APPLE STORE</div>
<div>GLASSES TIGHTENING</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>1/13</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>data all day. correlation matrices. javascript debugging. still crashing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>1/14</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>feeling super sober / hyper aware. good and nice.</div>
<div>much time spent on night, texting worldly perrin from tinder. thinking.</div>
<div>now young lean.</div>

<div>1/11</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thoughts on careers and life.</div>
<div>baba, linking to video about ~careers. follow value, not passion. reductive. little bit of value.</div>
<div>and baba, conversation about - starting to realize what you’re into (me saying data visual, design, etc) isn’t enough. research. (channeling ‘explore’ portion of video)? agreeing with this, should set up alumni chats.</div>
<div>exploration in careers. how can i create more situations where i test myself?</div>
<div>value, interest.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>confidence - and whether i should let myself engage in faith-based (rather than validation-based) confidence.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>feeling better about stef seeing other people. or calmer. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>dinner with dana - on a day when simultaneously confined but also not feeling like i have much to share for conversation - actually really nice, easy. three hours of hanging, cooking, conversation. </div>
<div>fragment: channeling ben lerner / atocha station - how narrator holds onto un - elegant aspects of one of the characters. christmas, in-depth, with family. nuclear family chilling.</div>
<div>do not blame self for silences, or lame conversations.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work today was whatever. no meetings or interaction. stupid tickets. deployment analysis report almost ready. (error query running now). by wednesday, hope to push out. bam bam.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>long talk with fam. summer, crushing harry potter. not being able to hold back-n-forth conversation. but enjoying the fragments. picnic outside, movie night. fun break time. </div>
<div>doof, not reading very much. wa wa wa..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>silly things i don’t usually journal.</div>
<div>- thinking a lot about my jeans. neuw. denim feels good, somewhat twill-like. classy, fitted. also shoes, hybrid runner desert boots. comfy. feeling it.</div>
<div>girls. girls girls girls.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>1/14</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Today, manifestation of horni ness and romantic loneliness? Texting Angela (hanging downtown), calling jade (2 hour chat), Tinder - most notably Perrin, who, sitting in bed, managed to back and forth message for an hour. Multi lingual/IR BU student</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Talking to jade about personality, how it's fluid, and how interests can be arbitrary, fleeting. Emerged from conversation about surfing, thought that wow people can decide to be so into something.</div>
<div>Jade saying that she talked mainly about herself. What's up with you? Stumbling a bit at question. Didn't give highlights reel (friends from home visiting, trip to NYC) and couldn't explain DC/NYC debacle. So give mishmash of events, spliced with life is up and down. Felt shitty about this - why am I not reading, producing, socializing, seeing things - and as a result producing things to talk about. But later - realized I talked about nyc m,</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>1/15</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>quality of life measured - not in events - but, in truest, deepest form, in the experience of the consciousness. life, in its physical manifestation, correlates, but does not cause richness. richness is in the brain. in the experience of taking in the mundane. in noticing, next to you, the strange, clumsy encounter between a father and his son, reading in tones of earnest care. conversation, focused on technical, meaningless details 'it's 97% charged dad, and pretty much 100', and dad retorting - in the split second between son's comment, and forming response, thinking that he will quip back cleverly - replies with a 'no, 97 is 97'. the dad, a humpty-dumpty sort of figure. white hair, bearded, round features accentuated by his personality - attentive to details, but in a clumsy, not-very-thoughtful sort of way. the son, wearing this hideous breed of climbing boots and croc - unjustifiable in its practical nature - and immediately lumping son into some sort of stereotype, one that i'm not yet aware of, but waiting for further cues to formulate. square wiry glasses, sticker-adorned laptop in hand. an awkward genius programmer? the sound of laptop being folded away. son is shifting physical position, subconscious - or not so much subconscious, the part of retrospective thinking that i call subconscious - is forming a new category, a bit startled at this sudden shift. at the boy putting the laptop away - the crux of my judgements, the basis for who he is, how he thinks, a reductive specimen of programming and clumsy quips with father, still clumsier - though, at times, thoughtful, thoughtful in how earnest, how sheltered this boy is, away from preconceived notions, common sense, and decorum - this impression dissolves in ticks of time as he awkwardly hugs the seat, back to the world, front slouching, sliding down, catching a glimpse perhaps of the planes that are about to depart. brain now disengaged, projecting less and taking in, for the next minute, catching on to father calling son 'sweetie' five or so years after this is okay - and now suddenly feel embarrassed. for him, for me, for making these judgements, for thinking that people can be reduced to playthings of my brain.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking of trying to explain this experience to someone else. not the whole day (whirring fragmentation). but this small segment, this observation. it isn't, and wasn't very affective. described in terms of something broader - that is, using these two people as projections for my voice, though process, and imagination - results in something palatable, explainable to others. but why must thoughts be so polished when explained to others?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>going back to end of conversation with jade last night. like this, tangentially, but related. how, after 2 hours of talking, of jade saying 'hey i've talked about myself quite a lot' i feel like i have little to share about my life. like i've done nothing. not true, as i've had weird collidings of worlds with friends from home, sister, may, conflicts of indecision and self-exploration, growing up while examining whether or not growing up is a fallacy, allowing myself, maybe for the first time to be happy with my way of thinking, to want to develop myself creatively, acquiring direction - the slighest direction, but direction for the first time nonetheless. but barring this (which at the, time didn't come to me, either because of cliche nature of describing the outcome of experience, without being able to describe the context - i.e. being me and living in this weird brain of mine- i end with. well life has mundane/routine, but up and down emotionally. offering little to jade, perhaps reinforcing whatever doubtings she (that i've formed as the basis for our relationship's dissolution) - and making me feel like, what am i doing with my life? or rather, am i doing anything with my life?</div>
<div>so countering this - because life is the collection of the consciousness, and only at a surface level (correlation level) the collection of external events and occurrences).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(this writing process, like everything today, incredibly fragmented. writing bits, leaving some behind, and returning to polish and finish others.</div>
<div>fragments.</div>
<div>text messages. text messages as fragments. is daily life this fragmented, or am i just in sync, attuned with the fragmentation? am i too fragmented to feel the fragmentation? ostensibly a shallow, show-off-y sentence, but holds weight, when read closely.</div>
<div>looking for fragments and noticing more fragments.</div>
<div>texting jade a context-devoid, probably vague and awkward, summary, of this, signing off with - enjoy your film editing - before noticing obvious fragmentation in this activity.</div>
<div>)</div>
<div>energy, a sudden stream of energy as words are spilling onto the page. richness of life, of course, also in the experience of taking in the exhilirating, the breathtaking and beautiful, and absorbing it.</div>
<div>(using the word invariably a lot today and not sure if i should be using inevitably but it sounds smarter and more precise)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a weird connection to people. i mean, not exchanging connections with people. just paying attention to more. at once, closer at more detached.</div>
<div>reading 10:04. fragments. consciousness, spliced together. in physical, chemical sense: author's consciousness unable to integrate, feeling just the local pieces.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>memories in the novel blending and bleeding.</div>
<div>novel bleeding into my life.</div>
<div>the narrative framing and writing process.</div>
<div>how today, moments of inspiration, energy coming to me (not having to seek). but how can i create this state of mind?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>physical, chemical: sleep deprivation - the driftiness, the melding of sense, of experiences, and memories - coupled with coffee, the ability to think, integrate this driftiness, and be aware. awareness, while letting oneself slide into memories.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>objective, event-based: switching from zones of work to preparation for this trip. from one itinerary to another.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today, in the hands of something greater. not god or fate or anything like that. coming to airport, announcement of delay. feeling not overwhelmed or underwhelmed - just whelmed, neutral. taking and experiencing consciousness.</div>
<div>soup hot. salty. not tasting it, so much as absorbing. state of mind where i'm just experiencing. in most immediate sense. as a result, feels like i'm not being intentional behind decisions - but also also satisfied.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>milwaukee, given reputation, midwestern stereotypes, carries suprisingly large # of orgahnic bakery food coffee places / food coffee places in airport.</div>
<div>now, finding myself in milwaukee. awake from nap, afloat, deplaned, feeling (don't say grounded) like i've reached the end of narrative arc. that now i'm clear. can reflect, think back.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>real-time: plane riding around in circles? ice issues? mogwai carrying through moment of non-though, until noticing what's going on?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>1/22</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>week like whoa go go go sick of work not really even doing many tickets kind of clicking around and brainstorming.</div>
<div>visual, so many iterations.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>“if it’s louder than my laptop, it’s too loud. either that or i need a white noise generator&quot;</div>
<div>i’ll turn it down…yes..yes…yes i’ll turn it down..i’ll turn it down..okay good night i’ll turn it down.</div>
<div>this means war.</div>
<div>fueled with the dramatic words and mentality of slavish.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>mixing tribulations to earl? and before that caribou? hm. it’s interesting but too rough.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>potential tinder date with reem? flattered that she’s so nice, but like you’ve only seen three photos of me? hm.</div>
<div>first impressions, manifested digitally.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div>and the </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i comproimse like a spork</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>what's happenin today</div>
<div>(take 2:</div>
<div>moving away (completely) from real talk real events? and focusing only on brain brain brain. true journal. </div>
<div>until then: earlyish wake-up (9 something? though sleeping at 3? naturally, just don't sleep in anymore). gym groceries (tj, warm bike ride, sort of sweating / guy asking me, in joggers and tiger shirt, if i know where ketchup is? dawg do i like like i work here?). happy vibrant people everywhere. weee. anderson paak taking me to TJ, heavy backpack, dangling canvas bag on way out. home and</div>
<div>siavash emerges, a vibrant sprite in his underwear. hearing his laughter (roaring, tumbling) before i see him, and then he comes in, stares at my fuckboi outfit, is about to make a comment before i say 'don't do to me what you to yahya, i don't have the iron-clad confidence'. he repeats this, laughter interrupting, emphasizing 'iron-clad'. it's like 1 pm now, i may have showered, plans with jackie, jeff and christian await pending cooking. at lunch, rosebud diner, feeling like i'm in a bus, feeling silly. staring at image of pie for 20 seconds. sharing bits about julia only coming to visit for ganj hookup. hearing about: last nights, company happy hour, bars with casey. plans for prov. rick and morty. ya know ya know. fun and happy and light. oh, also, popo at the place?! noise complaint.)</div>
<div>take 1:</div>
<div>the disparity between outer thoughts and word</div>
<div>bits of siavash convo:</div>
<div>conversations are legitmate. confounded at the idea of declaring a conversation deep when really just dipping toe in the water, still delving deeper. agreeing - what do people think about?</div>
<div>the tangent of: be intellectual or be bored</div>
<div>beautiful beautiful day bringing spring vibes</div>
<div>i mean a big coat but smiles and vibrant social people</div>
<div>including myself</div>
<div>groceries and gym (great workout, 5 reps sort of w/ 150 incline) = the usual, on paper, event-format, but beautiful exhiliariting morning. the mood infiltrating my body.</div>
<div>and trying to love myself</div>
<div>love myself?</div>
<div>anderson paak over and over and rapping</div>
<div>while cooking, butternut squash in the oven. rosemary, pesto, feta, hummus, diluted together, wafting and wading.</div>
<div>rapping about</div>
<div>not thankful enough, life objectively high quality and comfortable, nice apartment and friends and supportive family and stable well-paying job.</div>
<div>in my head: flashes of myself as a data visualizer, thoughts of doing front-end coding bootcamp. flashes of: last weekend, peter and yahya and co and feeling comfortable with myself.</div>
<div>and flashes - well not flashes, ruminations, processing last night: arcadia company party. the restrictive (artificial) social position that success can put you in. (ceo/sean, i'm sure saying thousands of words of pointless small talk and me, uncomfortable for him even though he's not uncomfortable).</div>
<div>but stepping back, event itself. the immediate entrance. an empty lobby, machine to enter (rock-style), elevator waiting for me. and dimly lit - though plain, very plain and minimal decor - everyone everyone in suits. spotting abhi and amrit from behind (after emptying bladder in dim lighting where i looked bad up close but sharper from far behind okay i can deal with that i guess it balances out?). and then: suits. people i know, and people i don't know, all in suits. laughter. the corporate type. maybe some real laughter lurking as well.</div>
<div>spouses. thinking of spouses: how arcadians are wifed-up, how they got wifed up, imagining, in incredibly reductive way, the life path that led to meeting, interacting. (flashback to that awkward moment in the liquor store running into ovidia, miming a hug, hugging the air, and moving along like it never happened)</div>
<div>and snippets: stephanie looking out for me, asking for criteria in woman. almaz, cute, cool, new york. the red tie as basis for conversation, division. 'you look dapper, dress like this always'. </div>
<div>and durty nellie's, 3/10, perhaps, layers of formalism released. or rather - intoxication, and no longer formalism, as the barrier to exploratory conversation. so what results: talk of weed, drinking, dating. (watching woman across me play some sort of block stacking game while listening to music and reading the newspaper. fascinating combo of activities).</div>
<div>outside for a cigarette (nice) w/ amrit and british-indian-sounding healthcare consultant living in new york. turning into fighting lesson, mentioning at least four fighting styles (melding into sort of porteguese wise-sounding rhythmic soup). techniques working - like working - my wrist feeling fragile, and a slight nick on my eye. hm. questioning, attempting to unpack. need for self-defense/motivation to fight.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back to - saturday, 1/30. home, reading a little bit, dinner w/ atlantic magazine (delicious combo of bns, feta, rosemary). shower and laundry and unsuccessful drying then angela's. angela looking cuter as we play board games, balderdash and guess who. us and a married couple - katie and johannes. both architects. the many stakeholders in architecture (realizing how i want to be in rapid prototyping minimal business, high-design environment). urban design and cities, conversation favoring west coast over east coast, specifically sf/la/portland over boston. tired, a it dazey from the few puffs of weed i had with siavash (now, can trace, very easily, trajectory of this strain: happiness and dancing and music craving to fuzzy, though still competent state of mind)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now sunday, 1/31</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>doing the morning and writing from diesel and running into amanda.</div>
<div>doddling doddling.</div>
<div>i mean like - cooking and showering and reading (not focusing, pretending to read), listening to music, on the way to ~tinder date. there at park station, anticipating that reem will be late. indeed was, just laid outside in the grass for a while. music, reading, half-mindedly, then settling on just watching the people. observing the ice skating rink - a diverse array of people (age, race b/c tourists) scraping along, looking happy. little boys, one in giant jacket, two in t shirts, chubby, kicking ball around frantically. beautiful, disorienting (spring-feeling, again) day. reem arrives, standing outside the station, and i make my way to her. a hug, hey, and feeling sociable. how are you. talking about my time at the park so far.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>2/1</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(was going to delve into the date but thought hey it's too soon i have too many thoughts - meaningless 'does she like me' thoughts interspersed with imagining her, thinking and framing time with reem, imagining even maybe that she likes me, abstract relationship development in head)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now thoughts a bit more grounded, and negative. texting reem like 2 hrs ago and no reply. stupid text that i regret. 'hey i dressed up at work (following conv of dressing up) and spilled shit all over me and my laptop)'. should have asked about her photography but like if she was interested she would reply so doesn't matter.. can sense and feel that i won't get a reply (has been responsive to every message until now, and talked explicitly about how she replies to texts within minutes). so the 'hey this was really fun' really just a polite goodbye. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday, the date. whirring, exhausting, nice, gentle, four-ish hours of conversation. at home after. feeling..mixed. like describing date to other people (in my head, so really to myself) - and it was good. like we hung out a while. and talked a lot. and she's smart. and gave me like a couple instances to think that maybe she was sort of into it. but didn't feel super deep connection - but also my standards and idea of romance is so..so unrealistic. flirtatiousness can work in lieu of deep conversation, and i'm not good at flirting, just at riding the flirt. (describing date afterwards to arushi and stephanie over slack, cute). </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>coming home feeling, feeling like what now? like not wanting to work. not wanting too..anything. to watch (watched 4 episodes of adventure time, with little affect). to read. to mix (mixed a little, about 5 minutes of inspiration then patience winding down). just there, existing. real estate feels good, but to restless to sit and only take in music. so do a bit of everything, and try to sleep around 10 and it's restless and i may or may not have slept well.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work - combo of spilling, mixed thoughts of date, and directionless what the hell am i solving all these tickets for - leading to uninspired, frustrated, dgaf day. nailing down specifics for poster at the end of day. realizing how little accountability there is in my job.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this entry = too literal, event-based. move move away. but needed to bent.</div>
<div>self-validation based on girls = more present, salient, than ever.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my main creative block is ~me. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>2/2</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Soo distracted by this girl why why why feeling shitty about being vulnerable and talking for hours and putting myself out there and also shitty for maybe talking too much about myself and not asking about her enough but maybe she wasn't interested and what did I do wrong and why why not me and I guess it's done</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<div>2/3</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>~lately on my mind</div>
<div>work / tickets. / tickets / tickets. imagining myself in meeting with gershman - where we sit down, and, before we can settle in our chairs, i erupt with ‘let’s talk about growth?’. how are you accommodating growth for me, for the company? and then we proceed to have honest conversation, where i admit that, maybe i should push harder work harder enough, but also suggest that maybe i need more exposure. more growth. and i relate it to - not just work, but self. i’m not learning. i’m just solving tickets. not interacting with people. brainstorming. exchanging ideas. no.</div>
<div>sort of resenting gersh - thinks he is hotshot, innovative, developing awesome team with crazy processes when he is an insipid, overly cautious, slighty above average manager. (‘got a meeting with cook, gotta run’ like get over yourself).</div>
<div>why am i here?</div>
<div>expressing to siavash, and like - am i crazy / should i leave / would you leave if you were in my position? no no and yes.</div>
<div>over mezcal, a conversation in five horses.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday - scotch and cigarette, alone. deer hunter, two albums loud, while editing javascript. drowning my thoughts out (obsessive negative thoughts, work and reem). siavish home - describing date / how i’m upset and a little angry at no reply - and, flash, a reply. okay. i’ll stop talking.</div>
<div>start to feel better quickly, but dangerous - how fragile my self-validation is.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>time at home lately. liberating, chill. reading, music, etc etc.</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>

(settling on: writing, light job apps, and ableton mix set-up).</div><div>(recalling pitch dark, how renata adler talks about her diary - a collection of thoughts and moods with no grounding in time or place. and though i’ve been thinking: disparity between external world/events and states of mind, musings is great, and that former is far more important, in essence a representation of who i am - perhaps the latter, the events, are more important in retrospect? or that states of mind, on their own, lend to a weird, self-centered image of the world? still fleshing out..)</div><div><br /></div><div>validation, girls. after initial text (internal) drama w/ reem resulting in actually quite nice little conversation - sending, tipsily, a ‘how are you?’ at 11pm on sat and receiving no reply = downer (though not like first time). consolation: checking tinder, seeing that she hasn’t been online in a week. is far away, and that she did reply last time, text sent most likely when she is sleeping after work day. and ~nice lil thread with jade (would have loved to see over weekend) / potential of hanging out on saturday. and call from stef. but earlier: before jade replied, when stef was unresponsive, and reem didn’t reply, down, confidence shot, mood down, melding with work dissatisfaction.</div><div>break it down. therapy style. validation reliant on feedback: from girls, romantically. is this problem? fixing problem = establishing a baseline of self-worth. afraid of doing this because? because part of my appeal perhaps, what makes me interesting is the my capability, occasional insight / clever comments / comfort, put-togetherness (that may indicate a sort of confidence) coupled with a penchant for depression, self-deprecation. though is that really part of my appeal? at least makes me humble, humbleness leads to open-mindedness leads to creativity and interesting thoughts? essentially, though i want to improve and work on myself, don’t want to..destroy whatever equilibrium causes positivity within me.~and that, acknowledging my positive qualities will..jinx them? a thought that his drifted in an out, though now, less salient since the age of..13? middle school. never have had evidence</div><div>quite the opposite: avoiding acknowledgement of my positive qualities = depression, feeling discomfort, losing touch with the parts of myself that i like.</div><div>..a continued conversation</div><div><br /></div><div>(..slow writing)</div><div>writing at the edge of consciousness.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>pitch dark. finished (first read, second pending)</div><div>along the lines i’ve been thinking lately.</div><div>writing and form as better representation for reality..</div><div>and fragments fragments..how some make sense and others don’t. how to, retrospectively, reflectively, translate thoughts into fragments.</div><div><br /></div><div>brain and drain and not feeling like writing more, really.</div><div><br /></div><div>~mind control. and meditation. revisiting these ideas, this time with siavash. seeing direct changes in siavish (proactive, simple things like thoughts of doing dishes actually materializing) but skeptical like - how can thought pattern be altered so heavily from a few sessions? though i suppose session was lengthy. but perception of self - as meditator, as doer, as productive person, resolution to be productive person - may be more influential than brain exercises?</div><div>(super bowl like whatever)</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>weekend - killington, vt. 2/6 - 2/7</div><div><br /></div><div>kid escaping playdate. leaving the party, a bit grumpy, and finding instead a quiet, empty swing. hands cold, swing sticky, promptly jumping off and replying to jade’s message. relaying the moment, the analogy, and adding in: hey, i’ll be in providence this weekend. </div><div><br /></div><div>otherwise. in the house, a loop of: it’s always sunny in philadelphia. board games/chess. ping pong balls throw at cups, spice racks, bottles. and drinking. a loop - made even more loopy by the fact that nobody addressed the loop, or really tried to escape it. milling about. putting on a changing music. reading a page or two. and half-heartedly entering and exiting conversations, leaving quips and comments. </div><div>with nick: a conversation about saudi and how it’s weird and ridiculous. little bit about family too. </div><div><br /></div><div>the escape, sunday. a calm, relatively wakeful (surprise) car ride with oren, bill, michael rogove. arcadians pre and post arcadia. my ambitions. oren’s view that consulting is not way to influence healthcare and hospitals (and, underlying ambition it seems, to work/change healthcare). josh as terrible manager (and in my head, also douchebag). lack of review system at arcadia. whether arcadia will be bought out and benefits of this. context.</div></en-note>]]></content><created>20160208T011516Z</created><updated>20190505T195143Z</updated><note-attributes><author>omarwnema@gmail.com</author><source>desktop.mac</source><reminder-order>0</reminder-order></note-attributes></note>

<!DOCTYPE en-note SYSTEM "http://xml.evernote.com/pub/enml2.dtd">
<en-note>
<div>2/9</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a straightforward bit. home and smoking alone and suddenly feeling better, inspired, and doing many things at once (pirating illustrator the main) and then - pop, siavash and adam. relatively nice time. </div>
<div>and sleep @ 1.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>2/10</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on the matter of being restless.</div>
<div>(on being bored. the uninteresting question of: restlessness ~ boredom?)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on the matter of: self maintenance. on the matter of requiring drugs trips altered states of mind intellectual stimulation girls and sex and social contact and inspiring music, creative work to exist, at a baseline, content level. on that matter. on the matter of: considering the act of answering (failing to answer) pop culture/sports questions in a loud bar, with people who i'm not in the first place all that compelled to see. on sitting, a minimalist in a minimalist apartment, frozen, listening to cars move, a hastily-eaten meal in my stomach. minimal: in thought, enjoyment, zest. minimalism. frozen: not by calmness, seized not by tiredness - but by the opposite, my inability to seize myself. (that's it, that's it i think..or at least the wordplay creates illusion of profundity). but sitting there, dealing with myself.</div>
<div>what a deeply philosphical problem. me.</div>
<div>on: chewing gum, a few pieces, over the workday, imbibing pretzels (do i even like pretzels?). on coffee and tea and tea and coffee and clicks to the other screen - not this one but the other one. the other ticket. the other issue. on half-finished ideas, flow diagrams and plans. i mean i could finish but where will i be and will this bring me even vaguely close to there? </div>
<div>on being: away. not here. not me. not now. not now. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>what on the matter? that's it. the statement, the declaration is the content. the matter is me, existing being and acknowledging where i am, how to maximize and occupy. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(i mean i can break it down further. but let's leave it at that for now)</div>
<div>for the first time in a few days. at ease (sort of). a shower, and calmness. a sense of being able to do something and maybe halfway enjoy it?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on the matter of renata adler. on form </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lately - actually criticizing own writing. a vision of: renata adler-like musings, thoughts, philosophical and pseudo-profound processing of mundane world. cynicism and restlesness, fragments and ~me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(spraying unfinished sentences all over the place, moving back and filling in gaps as i feel like it)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the house. minimalism. how that has seeped into my way of thought.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lately. the tendency to imagine conversations with other people (primarily fictional tinder girls) = rampant.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<en-note>
<div>2/13 morning - Noor engaged. Not thinking about this enough. Going about day really, the news making pause briefly - just for hm. Wow.
<div><br/></div>
<div>Channeling renata Adler in head, speedboat resonating - the pace the slight connection without broader</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Jade at coffee exchange. Nice actually. Work and things, little cynical sort of funny stories in enhance for farm film and strategizing broad context. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The day spent sitting, intermittent breaks of smoking. In congdon, benefit, and Williams for Maya's. Food too, omelette first, Thai, then fried Oreos, cookies</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Last night, formal. The thirty minutes leading, drifting after</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At night. At night at night we freestyle. Jaemun as coach. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>2/14</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10:30, up. Calling home - engagement a brief topic, largely logistical (these steps happened, party will occur likely around grad time). Noor as mystery reader (ideas?) mama with 'do you like Ahmed? Do you want a female version?'. Summer, finished Harry Potter, swimming hard. </div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>~slight hitch. En route to New York, rather than providence. -_- accept / make best / listen to Martin Courtney in prep 4 concert.</div>
<div>giddy during detour. sun, bright sun. beautiful day + cold makes one feel detached from environment (even when fully immersed). to our left, tracks, white tracks and to the right, industrial equipment strewn around.slavish and i pacing, joking. taking in sight of old old train station - tube tv and paper serving as status communication.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>experience of feeling more intimate, understanding someone and their way of thinking through theater. Siavash not being able to relate with hook up friend b/c way of conversation not grounded very rigorously in philosophy/logic. Processing purely through logic. Example of conveying depiction of college routine but playing through it, 20x, each time getting faster. Stimulating. How one may not be able to relay experience/state of mind clearly, despite having felt, understood, and thought about it. Words. Conveying states of mind.</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Reem / no reply. What to think. i know what i think and i know what to think but i don’t how to think what to think so i think i think i think. (and then there’s the jade..not replying to ‘hey was nice seeing you’. what does she think of me, what does she think? april down doe)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Time, how you cannot avoid but can actually void by denial. Or maybe can't. Somewhat constraining thought, but maybe something there, thinking in the bathroom. leaving thoughts behind as i enter steam, indulgence of shower.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>~back to boston</div>
<div>a quick: gym and groceries. racing the treacherous cold. cooking, chatting, two puffs of a j and casey at the front door. talking to casey, aaron, jacob: how was weekend? and the energy, the energy is low, i’m taking and holding onto passing comments and statements and using them as justification for why i’m different - so different from these northeastern white kids. </div>
<div>dangerous..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>casey’s = 40 degrees. in coats, talking tinder dates, eating pita chips, smoking dope.</div>
<div>jackie on the ride back. thoughts on casey + me? err..</div>
<div>the concert. smooth, tight, and relaxing. as expected. not the real estate oo oo so pretty fundamentally chill in my bones affect type of thing. but nice and good. martin, glasses, long hair, awkward, clean cut dudes you can bring to mother type of look.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>2/15</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>upright sitting, swaying swooning in autotune. simple elements becoming resonant, beautiful, moving, as i listen to kanye over and over.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lately. the rap flow. the rap flow goes, not always manifesting itself in real words but the beat flow rhythm is in me. should let out.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at home. at home like what should i do. fresh from work. today, easier to focus, to stop. no longer: what am i doing with myself myself self more just, jam and bob head, drift in a few thoughts, and think a bit about what’s in front of me (food).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>unraveling albums. (listening to kanye’s samples, brilliant integration)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work in a line. mundane and easy, putting out shit like access report, proposing new board for priorities meeting and steve like duuh. thinking, in depth, about why he is a shitty manager. getting shit done without passion. (and meeting with gleeson: rob down to have me on team, it seems, for sure, but gleeson like yo let’s spread this out. align your work with what you wanna do: more visualization, analysis, etc). where the ideas, the ideas at?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>resentment. no purpose it’s worthless. but if i look past the surface. like why am i working? why am i..serving the type of shit that ain’t gone get ya swervin. the type of shit that..make you stuck in your chair hurting / the type of shit that / make you feel like you deservin / a free and cool space of mind while you </div>
<div>er...</div>
<div>smoke a j and produce? okay..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>2/17</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>homewards.</div>
<div>the restlessness mostly dissipated, harmonious (w/ food, music) type of dinner.</div>
<div>lil bit of production. just a lil bit. admiring ableton interface - the amount of things you can do with just one screen. and splitting tracks into midi / drums / harmonies wow wow.</div>
<div>siavash interrupting (negative energy, he says). walking outside, holding mini j talking about too much self reflection as negative thing. talking, slightly tangentially, about how </div>
<div>adam over like 10 or so. siavish fading as we admire, head bop to life of pablo. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>2/18 (thursday)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work - making this new deployment dashboard that also allows for tracking. okay whatever. better than stupid tickets. did some stupid tickets, added finishing touches (text, layout criticism) for nick. </div>
<div>car ride with abhi. lately, enthusiasm in conversations low. freakonomics in the morning. already skeptical. every word/argument (episode about forecasting) discredited, debunked in my head.</div>
<div>home. ~frustration with abhi’s lateness. an adamant 6:15 turning to a?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>writing because i should write</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a 30 min stupor, tinder swiping. surmising the first line. nothing great. directed questions better than general.</div>
<div>things today.</div>
<div>william baskinski, ambient producer playing. siavash blasting his interview earlier today. an artiste.</div>
<div>okay.</div>
<div>first moments today. 11am, up. sun spilling. turning around and over. double blanketed, warm. jerk off because just needing to get that out of the way. the type of wake up that isn’t fresh new. the previous night - or rather, thoughts from end of previous night - carrying over into today. describing this feeling to siavash and, arriving at ‘emptiness’ to describe this feeling. like i’m missing something? like a pretty fun night out really. but the end. at the end, calculating. culmination. processing. and the reality of nora having committed relationship. inaccessibility. or, broader. feeling connected to someone. but not being able to curate a mutual intimacy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>with siavash. cooking - sizzles, slices. a conversation focused on me. siavash bringing out personal examples, as usual, but tying back to me. even refraining from sharing one because it’s not relevant. good at listening when clear goal/topic.  because: introspective.</div>
<div>relaying the brett story. how 1) damn i was judged quickly 2) feeling like i was interviewed (re:36 questions) in retrospect 3) confidence - maybe i should try to develop it and 4) damn she’s cute and interesting and this sucks. </div>
<div>‘i’m going to tell you, like pete told me..you would really benefit from meditation’. meditation evangelism appropriate here.</div>
<div>my viewpoint that nobody should be confident we should all be shy and meek and self-doubting. cuing laughter, but also a more serious discussion of whether i can develop this confidence without convincing myself, baseline, that i’m the shit. siavash’s approach, instead: meditate, when feeling pain like this. immediately meditate. observe, notice. feelings dissolve with lucidity. over and over, noticing, seeing. this will lead, naturally, to a different approach. no need to convince myself i’m the shit.</div>
<div>okay. great. a plan. how i’m gonna work on myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>but — the meditation reservations. creating thought that is - maybe too cohesive.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>is meditation the only way to deal?</div>
<div>years of being scattered flowing through life - maybe time to assess actual tendencies? echoing conversation with nora, boston bar. highly irish. singing contest, whiskey tasting like water. and this comment about testing for ADD (IQ / other tests) leading to some interesting conclusions about self. like figured out she’s really good with languages. conversations about curly frizzy hair. and hair. and getting ready in the morning.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the things i do.</div>

	<div>Waking up in retrospective regret:</div>

	
	<div><br clear="none"/></div>

	
	<div>Recalling the pattern of interaction last night. Making fun of each year, repeating recycled jokes/accents. Maybe some meaningful conversations. The walk outside upon yahya/Hersho's arrival (an incredibly difficult logistics challenge) - conversation about enjoyment and how planning factors in having fun.</div>

	
	<div>Returning from dinner - having overconsumed - to house of wired, stoned ambitious and interesting people? Everyone on own laptop.</div>

	
	<div>Adam walking in later, a-you-old-sad-fools look emerging quickly. Banter, elevated to a slightly higher leve. Though still quite low..heading to bed at 1am, a sort of </div>

	
	<div><br clear="none"/></div>

	
	<div>Hersho's reckless driving offense. No glasses, and cocaine. 8k to cover case. Fuck. Last May. Damn hersh ..</div>

	
	<div><br clear="none"/></div>

	
	<div>Armenians and Armenia.</div>

	
	<div><br clear="none"/></div>

	
	<div>Talking to mama about Ahmed (noor's fiance). Motivation to marry for passport? Looks, not a fan. Skeptical overall. Perils of summer and yousuf management. Business of work (measured in Fitbit steps).</div>

	
	<div>This is life man, this is life. Why is this life? </div>

	
	<div><br clear="none"/></div>

	
	<div>In the T station, younger vaguely attractive women talking to early 40s French hat and hiker boot man. Flask of alcohol in hand. 'You drink a lot on trips. like a lot.'. Real people. Second hiker boot 40 year old white man, acid pants-adidas hoodie clad southeast Asian. Nerdy Asian couple, glasses, phone screens in at similar angles, distances. And more and more. </div>

	
	<div><br clear="none"/></div>

	
	<div>Take a break from greens, focus focus and get things done at work.</div>

	
	<div>coming back from trip with fresh sneaker-looking, thin profile, lil shiny boots. in2it.</div>

	
	<div><br clear="none"/></div>

	
	<div>at tinder and trying to trace the patterns of one-liners. like ‘i’m probably doing x’ or themes of food, dogs, beer, myers-briggs test, sports teams. anything flies when you’re trying to describe yourself. world has accepted that it is huge challenge.</div>

	
	<div>or other perspective: we are shallow meme-like creatures. all of these posts that say nothing about a person are perfectly curated because we in fact are nothing. but parts of larger trends and ideas etc</div>

	
	<div><br clear="none"/></div>

	
	<div>actually ending up smoking after resolving - in fact repelled by ganj. but feeling quite awake, enjoyed food, had short freestyle stint with hersh that’s okay.</div>

	
	<div><br clear="none"/></div>

	
	<div>hersh yahya and siavash on laptops. really. really really. what are you doing.</div>

	
	<div><br clear="none"/></div>

	
	<div>this weekend like wow looking back a blur (not really, can recall clearly, but some what scattered) and fragmented. are scattered and fragmented the same? don’t know.</div>

	
	<div><br clear="none"/></div>

	
	<div>hitting ableton. when returns diminish, so does interest. need to combat this.</div>

	
	<div>combat: restlessness, fast eating, and associated negative behaviors.</div>

	
	<div><br clear="none"/></div>

	
	<div>overhearing harsh and yahya go back and forth and back about brother + shroom friend’s address. this sort of unproductive conversation..</div>

	
	<div>the t. reflecting, going uptown, on how it’s expanded brain space this weekend. given my tangible humans to project thoughts onto. confinement expanded.</div>

	
	<div>feeling melancholy moved from alex g. </div>

	
	<div><br clear="none"/></div>

	
	<div>girls girls girls girls girls. :s.</div>

	
	<div><br clear="none"/></div>

	
	<div>~eclipsing the conflicted thoughts about this weekend. this uneasiness about the weekend, at some points, put aside. thoughts, to large extent, put aside. simply absorbed in the world. allowing unseasonal weather to disorient me, color me happy.</div>

	
	<div><br clear="none"/></div>

	
	<div>—i’m quite good at putting work aside. broader ambitions, as usual, playing on some sort of loop, but day to day work minimized and put aside. bye bye</div>

	
	<div><br clear="none"/></div>

	
	<div>fragments no longer intentional writing style but actually the nature</div>

	
	<div><br clear="none"/></div>

	
	<div>feeling weird and spacey - hearing hersh’s voice in various strangers. a strange sort of sativa. </div>

	
	<div>feeling like my stream of consciousness is mush and i should merge it. consolidate it. with one singular experience. watch a show. read a book. walk outside. etc etc. single patient report exploration. do something. after this tinder message..</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>this girl - pilar - on tinder. seems cool n spunky but still 21 :s.</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>night time - guests having left - scrolling on internet, jerking off 2nd time. then walk with siavash. cool, pleasant, calm. staring at buildings, houses. siavash a fan of the creepy corner building on cameron. the impracticality, the visual effect. me: das ugly. but cool at night actually.</div>

	
	<div><br clear="none"/></div>

	
	<div><br clear="none"/></div>

	
	<div>2/22</div>

	
	<div><br clear="none"/></div>

	
	<div>morning dance. coffee, sunlight, shower.</div>

	
	<div>afternoon trance. tickets, tickets, tickets.</div>

	
	<div>a meeting with steve that i did not really plan. monthly check-in, as always, incredibly awkward. mainly because, when i'm not directing conversation / throwing words in the air, steve is there. static with unwavering attention. incredibly uncomfortable. implied that i want to move to product without articulating this very clearly. </div>

	
	<div>an interminable hour, 5-6 pm waiting for ride. </div>

	
	<div>the slight resentment @ work (abhi, steve, affiliates) persisting. like abhi relaying this story about jokingly telling simon cab driver called him russian jew, cab driver noticing and like ‘hey!’. and i’m just sort of eye rolling. though it is kind of funny. these people aren’t inspiring. so ~inspire yourself. inspire yourself.</div>

	
	<div>peeing a lot.</div>

	
	<div>pretzels.</div>

	
	<div>ur. gh.</div>

	
	<div>i’m not getting anything done at work so might as well do my own work the whole time?</div>

	
	<div>how (/have i) been learning and growing? have not been, have not..</div>

	
	<div>but focus on lucidity. coming home. not a hint of tiredness. throwing together a quick meal. ordering things and doing stupid scrolling online. procrastinating the eventual return to post-work work. single patient report stuff.</div>

	
	<div>(a shower to get my mind off life)</div>

	
	<div>most of my time today spent: touching my toes to see where they fit in new (fly) boots. and google searching variants of doc martens and improper sizing. should i have ordered a different size? over and over in my head. &lt; could be a weird short story</div>

	
	<div>trying to kickstart a ‘my life through data’ type series.</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>start could be like ‘things get murky as a data scientist. or something about, the point in which you allow data to infiltrate your life. or how i approach my life incredibly imprecisely / contrast with data. or like silly data visuals of friends and commute and stuff sketched out. really musings can’t be complete without visual..</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>2/23</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>splendor and running with shin pain, morning.</div>

	
	<div>work and drudgery, most of day. ping pong weak. awake though, relatively sharp. finally fixed deployment table, actually checks for </div>

	
	<div>during sprint review like ‘should i bring up feedback mechanisms?’.</div>

	
	<div>leaving work via bus. and quite glad actually. (early + light = nice, makes commute enjoyable). on the bus and it sort of smells, working-class people abound, the quirky person reading 1000 pg novels, the sleeper, the keeping it real with ma beats on. and car rides mostly me pulling words together. or worse yet, encouragement, affirmation. feigned encouragement so difficult. like oh yea i’ll have to check that out. chill. awesome. yea i think i heard about that. hm. yea maybe sometime. hm. cool. oh. oh. oh cool. cool oh. so the bus, pleasant. nicely distracted as i’m reading renata adler,  sharp and perceptive of space while listening to him hecker. </div>

	
	<div>journey leading me home. where</div>

	
	<div>witnessing siavash incredibly angry / outraged (fist-pounding) at package delay (carrying synth). what a privileged anger / emotion. a bit appalled really. and questioning self: does this happen to me?</div>

	
	<div>what have i really done in my 6 months at work? not much, but what do others do? less?</div>

	
	<div>lively banter. white girl accent, on point, siavash enjoying, and then explaining in depth my decision to use ‘you’/second-person in my joke. siavash impressed, laughing. siavash sometimes impressed easily (or on odd notes) in humor. </div>

	
	<div>new york, soon soon.</div>

	
	<div>taking a moment to think about craziness and mental disorders after thinking about how i do trivial somewhat obsessive activity like chewing gum. or snacking. or constantly checking phone. normal twenty-first person shit i suppose, but can write paragraph that has abrupt shift in transition.</div>

	
	<div>marketing piece for work: datathon and creativity</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>Siavash's friend (name??) over last night, a somewhat skinny, bearded, upright-standing handsome personable man. A firm handshake, eye contact, and questions about me. A little bit difficult to interact with people who are so superlatively good at interacting with others.</div>

	
	<div>Sharp and considerate: after a long tangent following a question I asked, managed to get back to question and offer answer. Always offers something to say, or way of affirming that still may open up conversation to continuing (even if it doesn't need to)</div>

	
	<div>I'm a person shit and people can analyze me like this.</div>

	
	<div>At way fair: a relationship manager with suppliers. Calls and talking all day all day. Oh me oh my.</div>

	
	<div>Maybe switch back to bus commute? In morning, 351 nice and calm. Opportunity to work (if maybe hotspot functions..)</div>

	
	<div>Conversations of: ye album. An articulate exchange of opinions. How this not a perfectionist album, but ye is okay with that, friend says. Me: the production, where Kanye is, and how it sounds good. How's it's shallow but Kanye is at a shallow, starstruck point in his life, and it depicts this well - so album is in fact deep. </div>

	
	<div>Of: work. Guy Siavash admires, incredibly sharp, quick-thinker. And taking apart the idea of quick-thinking: is that truly the quality these people are exhibiting? Or is it a show of intuition and comfort. Similar ideas, we sort of conclude before moving to siavash's room for some tunes.</div>

	
	<div>Minimalism can be confining </div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>2/24</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>oneohtrix playing. before, an other experimental beat, and several other songs while taking steamy steamy shower.</div>

	
	<div>feeling great after a hit of ganj. did work, exchanging attempted-funny/snide remarks on slack. and more stuff. and feeling ~sharp, somewhat motivated.</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>shower marketing article ideas. thinking how slightest change query/syntax/functional change goes through many many hoops.</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>(stupid) backend creative piece for marketing. how slightest query/syntax/functional change goes through so many steps. guardians of the database or something like that. something that draws attention to the weird phenomenon of so many real actual people as managers of data. data as a volatile thing.</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>other piece: the problem of structuring creativity, and datathon being a perfect solution.</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>renata adler putting me in a renata adler state of mind. what went through my head bus ride back home? mainly reading, staring @ people. thinking a bit about communion, revisiting my judgments of repeated passengers.</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>and i thought: i have never been called a beautiful beast before..as the beginning of a story</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>kale eggs quinoa for dinner it’s okay. satisfying doe.</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>evening: practice ~arcadia academy. get good questions for dr. rich. send alyssa stuff. work, but sort of interesting work stuff.</div>

	
	<div><br clear="none"/></div>
	<div>2/25</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Anti climax: </div>
	<div>+ phone call with Alyssa. First idea sort of original, second not so much. Encouraging but Alyssa already default encouraging so not that helpful overall. Also slightly awkward. Not knowing what to say to overly thanking thank yous, when really I should be thanking.</div>
	<div>+ boots too big. Ordered smaller, waste </div>
	<div>+ presentation, after much practice and focus, receiving largely reconstructive feedback.</div>
	<div>+ Stef and poster feedback </div>
	<div>+ meeting with dr rich. Short and like: yea doctors prob gonna stick to EHR and not use this?</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>But ny tonight = fun?</div><div><br/></div><div>Sort of thoughts I'm having like: need to eat less and feel light? Like: gershman: did you kick off nightly job then make change to task flow? Yes I did and not the first time I've fucked up with this but fuck I don't fucking care this shit is so boring. My boots are too big, softened up, I realize they are too big. There's a lesson in here? Cute girls on the bus, cute girls. Empty but cute girls cute girls. Across from me, all black, nirvana shirt, yoga pants, runners. ~the quiet, intellectual city of Boston. Books abound.!(phones of course too)</div><div><br/></div><div>The last couple hours at work. Working on some issues, and inching towards the door. Mentally at least. Coding this square status checker - which isn't all that exciting but diff cool applicable fun skills. Hm, Steve letting me do this is nice / setting me up for good future position? Or, sees benefit for team / knows I may go crazy without personal projects. Like fuck. Fuck, in the background of my head.</div><div><br/></div><div>This office. What is it. What world do I find myself in? Is seeing how a company works really that interesting? </div><div><br/></div><div>Beautiful feeling, streaming through my body as I get increasingly more tired, immersed in the beach house aesthetic. First and last albums.</div><div><br/></div><div>What's made me smarter? Rooming with Adam and Siavash? Little bit of own work. Little bit of work work. </div>

How Daryl is somewhat thankful (for parents, heritage, etc) that he's back home. How I feel like I'm losing everything connecting me to home.</div><div><br /></div><div>Weed and alertness. Small amount creating nice easy conversation. Even logically / philosophically justified. Deep you might say.</div><div><br /></div><div>Vashty on the street post dinner. Business attire, quickly inquiring/examining different parts of daryls life. Walking to: where? Already sort of agreed like nah no bars. </div><div><br /></div><div>His reviews and jokes. Making him laugh hysterically at..joke? </div><div>Cat trees. Siavash's delivery on point, laughing hard sitting on concrete gate. Sitting on concrete gate mid street = home. </div><div><br /></div><div>Do you think that therapists never run out of material to talk about? (Recalling conversation with Adam about psychiatry, fascinating but absorbing)</div><div><br /></div><div>Fading fsding at 12:40 and like is this okay or am I supposed to be krazy and awake but then returning to the thought of friendship without gaps and me being tired and migos wed and like I suppose this is okay.</div><div><br /></div><div>3/1 (most written from bus earlier)</div><div><br /></div><div>work and meeting about structuring feedback. maybe not assertive enough. i should be more assertive. ended up saying ‘like hey can you keep us in the loop about broader things’ and like ‘maybe we should have better feedback structures i’ll think about it kk’. and then steve talking about how he manages his life in sprints. a bit appalling really.</div><div>but major progress in restructuring dashboard thing.</div><div><br /></div><div>~home (abhi overall unreliable with getting ride today) at like 6:30 or 6:40. daryl cooking, me unwinding, and casey, very shortly after, over. how are you’s. dating talk coming in quickly, casey and a girl at brown.</div><div><br /></div><div>with daryl, some light watchu been up to. good touristy day: cemetery, magpie lil gift shop in davis. biking around, seeing mystic river. and trader joe’s. impressed. and makes me think: hey, lots to do here.</div><div>with casey, to food, joint, wine, quite quickly. and singapore. empathizing and interweaving our own stories. many jokes about dating younger people. what’s going on with daryl’s friends. tzun hun etc. daryl and his routine.</div><div><br /></div><div>psychiatry: a thought lately, and then meeting siavash’s friend. brown plme, about to graduate from med school. spending time in honduras. casey recalling this american life episode about crazy crazy guy who thought he was president got shot etc, and siavash’s friend sharing personal example of cousin who had similar (minus violence) experience. whoa whoa whoa. thinking about michael. talking about mania, siavash about his need for mediation and me like really really is it necessary for you dude?</div><div>talking about psychiatry, med school </div><div>learning spanish through psychiatry. what.</div><div>a long debate about: freedom. how constraint can be freeing. me disagreeing, getting kinda semantic, dropping, and then revisiting later. recalling apathy argument with colin. (guess i have strong feelings about words or something)</div><div>listening to, various things: deer hunter, arcade fire, jeremih, anderson paak.</div><div><br /></div><div>mania, revisiting. well first acid trips. then manic trip spring weekend, perhaps again with jade. mania. </div><div>long winding walk to roof of tufts library. revisiting college life like hm. senior year last two months as absolute best time of life. talking about meditation initially on walk. the weird mind game and instructions to follow to get cartoony characters to pop up, that yosemite trip. that day. was colin distressed that day? didn’t entirely catch. cold water and the white man. whistling trees. bliss. guy who got profoundly lost, proceeded to do hike quickly, before leaving. would we really want to revisit this scene? a beautiful, untouched memory. nyc and providence backwards. </div><div><br /></div><div>chattering from siavash’s room. soreness and stiffness in my body, distract from jackie’s texts and tinder. and getting ready to sleep. on my mind, that’s what’s on my mind.</div><div><br /></div><div>tinder date, happening</div><div>Vashty's intensity </div><div>Do focused people stay on same thought for long time? What about when it's exhausted?</div><div><br /></div><div>casey out. warmth, daryl passing out.</div><div>Mamas limit to fun </div><div><br /></div><div>3/2</div><div><br /></div><div>work - orchestrating drug deal (daryl + kadir). planning pizza party. pizza showing up at casey’s just as we enter. </div><div><br /></div><div>err body yell. migooo.</div><div>a relentless energy. bars bars bass. keeping up for like 30 min. hannah montana especially, charging forward, bouncing bouncing. few songs after,  </div><div>no versace? no boston encore perhaps, crowd tired.</div><div><br /></div><div>mind: 3x each coke, weed, drinks. but at some point in the concert. feeling sober, sharp. like maybe everything cancelled out?</div><div><br /></div><div>coming home</div><div><br /></div><div>3/3</div><div><br /></div><div>breakfast at mr. crepe. sun shining. smirking as we talk. about: my unsustainable fitness in college (disagree). dating.</div><div><br /></div><div>leaving daryl. sunny surreal, and, after missing both buses to work, feeling like kid skipping school. uber out to office..</div><div><br /></div><div>at work. front-end design not always so gratifying. i am drawn to ideas, creative ideas, and design as a representation of creative ideas. but coding interactive squares really isn’t all that creative..</div><div><br /></div><div>strong thoughts of going back to school..</div><div><br /></div><div>conversations with siavash. deep and exploratory, but assuming/not questioning the broader ideas. for ex, conversation about friends from brown moving to boston, creating new scene, disrupting [rpgress in trying to be new n fresh. but not questioning the basis: the feeling of ‘ wanting to change ‘. it doesn’t mean, being more productive. it’s this weird abstract thing. and we both feel and understand it, but don’t question it. we just question everything else.</div><div>are we living the new lives we wanted to live? no.</div><div>willpower. getting oneself to do things, and comparing, in trivial situations, the state of mind that might lead to (ex) dishes being done or left. picking this apart, realizing that what gets me to do things is not so much satisfaction/planning ahead (though part of it) but more living up to the person i want to be. imagining roommates using kitchen, seeing that i leave things sparkly clean. this is who i want to be. in situations where this doesn’t happen, thought</div><div>is this what being present is about? less about being present, immersed, but more being aware of presence that gets me to do things. though perhaps they go hand in hand.</div><div><br /></div><div>mind. consistency. </div><div><br /></div><div>sadness from daryl leaving, innovation day and wanting to push myself, nervousness over date = caffeine abuse. </div><div><br /></div><div>to be a writer, you have to step back, and realize how ridiculous day to day life is. how interesting, rich, and ridiculous.</div><div><br /></div><div>~the date. not as pictured. cigarette pre-shower, frantic half espresso shot in shower, compulsive eating to combat shakiness caused by stimulants. for what, for what, for what?</div><div><br /></div><div>border cafe. harvard square. packed, waiting like 30 min. talking about the broad sort of what do you do what are you doing in life? her, screenwriter. going into writing later. like do you feel like you cater your life to more extreme/intense experiences for sake of writing material? not quite, but definitely mindful of what could be potential material. and thinking of framing experience while having experience. </div><div>different angle of writing. asking people what they think about same experience. perspective. and get into depth, gossip, so that you can frame a story from different angles.</div><div><br /></div><div>realizing how i couldn’t recover from superficial shock / disappointment in pilar’s looks. dwelling on it mentally for the first few minutes, and as a result, not very enthusiastic in this social interaction. </div><div><br /></div><div>lately, headphones off. walking thinking. happier with my brain perhaps? or unhappy with music choice. or neither, apathetic, existing, moving.</div><div>boots feeling better with insoles.</div><div><br /></div><div>~my problem of: not being able to focus, zone in, and finish one thing. lateral movement, too often.</div><div><br /></div><div>3/4</div><div><br /></div><div>from, to-do list:</div><div>TONIGHT = MICHAEL'S</div><div>TOMORROW = HOME DEPOT</div><div><br /></div><div>what i’m going to do, between now and going home:</div><div>+ switch up workout, eat crazy healthy. 1x/week heavy weights. german volume or circuit rest of week.</div><div>+ work on new project. get excited about work, focus. work hard outside work</div><div>+ smoke less dope</div><div>+ make house better living space (saturday)</div><div>HOME DEPOT</div><div>+ finish that marketing piece!!</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>~~shower ideas. exiting shower, slightly high, adam cooking, like: man, get my best ideas in the shower.</div><div>Talking about rap
</div><div>Have you written?</div><div>
</div><div>And synths and hardware dope</div><div>
</div><div>And like why is Siavash complaining about having to contribute to cooking?</div><div>
</div><div>And I feel small small. Context: friends from brown, different city, weird tinder date, and work  (dull work).</div><div>
</div><div>Ah man man</div><div>
</div><div><br /></div><div>
</div><div>Deciding to up game in everything.</div><div>
</div><div>Recalling frustrating drive with abhi judging kendricks album and things like 'oh he has lots of jazz ensemble' and 'haha he said what did Indian say' and 'haha pimp pimp hooray'</div><div>
</div><div><br /></div><div>
</div><div>Cold hands fuck fuck ow face visibly pained (does this help alleviate pain)? But then home. Kitchen really for 2 hours.</div><div>
</div><div><br /></div><div>
</div><div>Hm. Feeling like there's more to explore in a what am I doing with my life thought space. And finallt some conviction about this company. Hm. Maybe revisit journals?</div><div>
</div><div><br /></div><div>
</div><div>Marketing piece, ideas in the shower. Actually interesting stuff to think about in this rigid job. Revisiting paper about ads rated more creative under template. Maybe just says that society is indutrialized and no longer recognizes creativity.</div><div>
</div><div><br /></div><div>
</div><div>Tech recognizing and registering more nuances than language does.</div><div>
</div><div>On structuring creativity.</div><div>
</div><div>Data governance, system of checks and balances.</div><div><br /></div><div>3/5</div><div><br /></div><div>Writing 3/6 first, and, one hour into writing, sort of exhausted. </div><div>
</div><div>Doing what I feel. Doing what I should do, said I should do. When at Michael’s (crafts) like: why am I here. Already 4pm. Time wasting. Long walk. Could have ordered online.</div><div>
</div><div>Need to acknowledge, with things like decorating, self-improvement, process does not always yield outcomes immediately. Though in this case: two framing type of things for Murakami postcards, so so let it slide and ride. </div><div>On topic: force myself to continue, spill out thoughts? Maybe not. I like my brain most of the time, just want it to be more focused. But not in like forced way..</div><div><br /></div><div>Hours on the phone. Holla at ya momma (‘what’s new’, ‘what’s new’). Spitting the work deal, the near-future plan. (Pretty convinced of: product team or new job or grad school or bootcamp and back2arcadia). Hearing about: summer and yousuf. Swimming, fighting. Conversation lingering, chatting slowly. Sun beaming, window open.</div><div>Next up: Maliha. Genuinely happy</div><div>Me and my ambitions (wow that took you a while</div><div>The emergence of self-awareness. A fascinating thing</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>at jackie’s party: </div><div>Mike (and bro friend, hi bro friend from work). Mike looking like bro a bit, broad shoulders, chiseled face, plaid. Something beautiful in the idea of going in depth with someone but never seeing again? </div><div>Jackie: professing liking to Casey. Casey err don’t know what to say. </div><div>Dana: talking about, past few weekends. Fundamental boredom, being frozen by boredom. Boredom of self, not the world.</div><div>Cute philipino girl from philly (Penn grad, visiting). What you do, what you do? Conversation is hard. Thinking, while talking, listening, damn what do I say next? Do other people get anxious.</div><div>christian: so much respect</div><div>Christian, a tender: 'a have so much respect for you man’ goodbye. Helen, a gentle, drunken hug. Allie, Mat, planning brunch later. I like these people. You’re not my people, but I like you. Judgmental? </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>3/6</div><div><br /></div><div>(real-time writing, fragments in action)</div><div>A granola bar with a catch: christianity. Hope fellowship church offering Chewys. Sunny day, jackets open, contemplating this for a second. Maybe ten seconds. A whirr of ‘that’s a different world, not ready to take apart right now’. Going back to thought of: interesting one-liners. A sort of: somethingness in nothingness. The meaningful inferences, judgments of a person emerging not from the content of line but choice to put this line there. Analogies? Like going to a museum, and paying attention only to the curation of art. Or like reading a book, and not taking in anything about characters or plot - just using narrative as a means to diagnose author’s thoughts. </div><div>‘The five second rule is complex.’ ‘I’m the type of person who eats leftovers bits and crumbs in the jacket.’ Then the more tinder lines. The ambitious, straightforward explorer: ‘I like to explore and be spontaneous’, ‘Looking for adventures’. The implied, ambitious explorer: ‘looking for a muse, someone to expand my brain’. The reduction of personality to material goods: the pizza lover (‘pizza or i’m out’, ‘let’s watch girls and cuddle’). The not-struggling struggler: ‘life is a constant struggle of: coffee or beer?’. The tool-cool-for-tinder tinder user: ‘we probably have nothing in common’, ‘like why am i even here’, ‘this was totally a bet’.</div><div>Can I make a sort of art project-y thing out of tinder? Or a more interesting, extended piece? Like: comparison of one-liners to actual people. I mean, people shouldn’t be my playthings, but I suppose they can be. Thesis: how does the one-liner compare to the person? Maybe: the one-liner on top, the profile, my interaction, and a re-branded profile on the bottom. Not really novel, but still: could be meaningful, interesting. Definitely expanding journal in different direction.</div><div>Me. Now me. What’s a catchy one-liner? No no, what’s a meaningful, honest one-liner. How can I distill me into one line. Maybe: ‘looking to make my brain bigger, really’. A stupid exercise, this one-liner thing. 
</div><div>But again: even if I do not represent this, stated mission ~ values? Hm.</div><div>
</div><div>Or. Or or. Taking one liners and constructing person, meeting them and seeing what relates?</div><div>Young mother, stroller rolling over my jacket. Smiling, moving politely. Men next to me. Late 30s, early 40s? One: dabbling on: tall buildings. Looking at: screensaver of tall buildings. The other: entertaining briefly, then back to music editing. In front, standing, algebra and trig book, ramones shirt, belly. late 20s. Focused, swaying, studying proofs line by line. Inspiring. People doing different things. Should come here on weekdays, get inspired?</div><div><br /></div><div>so many thoughts cannot keep with thoughts. and things to do. how do i get frozen, unable to do things? pick one, pick one. remember 2 be decisive. other new years resolutions, how are we faring: being more responsive. not bad. doing what i want to pursue, long-term? err could use some work.</div><div><br /></div><div>FOCUS. </div><div>Not as command. The topic of focus, swimming in my brain. What does fact that I do not delve deep, but instead follow scattered interests, what does it say about me, about my intelligence, preferences, and personality?</div><div><br /></div><div>
</div><div><br /></div><div>
</div><div>How self-awareness is emerging</div><div>
</div><div><br /></div><div>Okay, into diesel. Not much sunlight, but some grunge, diversity (of white people, in age really, not real diversity). </div><div><br /></div><div>Clothing lately: the black mesh varsity shirt, plain black shirt, black and grey striped oversized, off-white oversized. who are u? </div><div>Music lately: new Kendrick. Beach House, DIIV, jeremih, etc. Nothing that new..mix it, mix it up.</div><div><br /></div><div>Journal as: thoughts/fragments, documentation (what I’m doing, listening to, etc), and </div><div>Data collection 4 life. Pursue this as a side project? Need to narrow this a bit.</div><div><br /></div><div>@night:</div><div><br /></div><div>cooking sort of bland stir fry. spice harder, cook slower, eat slower. </div><div>a walk with vash. a talk with stef.</div><div>and, glass of whiskey, and classical music before bed. (open my mind up, thinking, to orchestras. somehow drifting into thought (partly: what do i text tinder roksana back?)).</div><div>thinking, getting synth, how nice it would be to play some hardware. how much my brain would expand by actually learning instrument.</div></en-note>]]></content><created>20160228T220124Z</created><updated>20190505T195120Z</updated><note-attributes><latitude>0</latitude><longitude>0</longitude><altitude>0</altitude><source>mobile.iphone</source><reminder-order>1456697129000</reminder-order></note-attributes></note>

<en-note>
<div>whoa </div>
<div>zah.</div>
<div>3/7</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>what’s your morning like?</div>
<div>morning is like: waking up mind racing racing sun outside and up pre-alarm</div>
<div>into shower. and, simultaneously: ironing, toasting/making toast, 3araby coffee, preparing backpack for day. pieces coming into place, and sitting in room, admiring recent decoration, getting down to kendrick -&gt; beach house.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work waiting?</div>
<div>but life is so good now.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and work. </div>
<div>not being pushed, not being pushed. after conversation with omar (ben halim) yesterday, siavash explaining the fast pace of his own work. constant thinking, working, meetings, coffees, what’s ups, opinions. me: static. sitting (occasionally standing). meetings of little consequence. repetitive tasks. little insight into healthcare. feeling patronized, underutilized. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home. incredible calm. cooking a bit more slowly (chopping herbs, not just rushing to eat). and breathing between bites. silence. clank of forks, whirr of cars, whirr of thoughts.</div>
<div>'okay okay what did i do today? no no actually let stare at this plate, the colors, focus on taste. no no recap day, process it and get it out. wait no focus on what i’m doing today'</div>
<div>shopping for end tables. more funky, i want it more funky.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>looking at spotify job postings. cool: product designer, data scientist, front-end engineer, apps and visualization designer. oo la la.</div>
<div>plans plans plans.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>how is the brain of writer different?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it’s quiet, brain feels vacant, and thoughts are..too easy to extract. or brain is too solid, thoughts aren’t falling and spilling on the page.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>3/8</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>keeping a ‘nice fragments’ list. wishing i had done this earlier.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a couple puffs of weed and i’m more positive. it’s weird.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>how is my brain wired?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>jamming out on the synth on some hi-pass filter, sequenced choppy dance shit. yes.</div>
<div>showing siavash my fragments. idea of posting hundreds on a piece of paper, printing. </div>
<div>then: expanding idea, making into some sort interactive visual.</div>
<div>also: journal text parser still stands as kewl idea</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>watching dave harrington other people issue with video recording and got it would be amazing to be a musician.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>showing siavash kendrick’s ‘u’ (swooning everytime) and two songs off untitled unmastered (07 dope).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i’m an artist fueled by the mundane.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>3/9</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Beautiful cross-section of suburban and urban society on the bike ride back from work. Future disspating into forth wanderers, sun getting simmer, population growing denser, and more people passing by. In a whir.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Kids going to school. Picturing the high school stereotypes walking by. Shirtless jock, hot driven smart girls, etc. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The Davis square guitarist, jamming. He is his #1 fan. Which is respectable I suppose.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Thinking of parsing fragments of thought data analysis project. Assign categories, like said alone or with others around? And color categories. Maybe see how color can change meaning? This is veering.</div>
<div>A cool day in my brain but not externally. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Thinking about how I'm thinking 'I live for warm weather'. A superficial thought expressed externally but earnestly and honestly evaluated, justified. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Ay ay girl u mad decent, as chorus for a song. </div>
<div>Never been a perfectionist I wreck my shit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Do you rap in your head? I mean sort of. Manifests in a sort of mumble.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Furniture with offset colored shelves </div>
<div>A fully araby family. Decked out with grandpa</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Today at work. A haze. contacts on. Sweaty, post bike ride. Network connection issues, stupid deployments. Really just admin work all day, minus couple of meetings. Walk with Amy outside. Chilling by myself outside. Actually sort of beaming, throwing smiles and conversation at people in the morning. With Albin, talking in meeting about how I feel like I’m not growing. His answer: you’re passively growing (inferred: in the healthcare business sense). Hm. Interesting to hear about context in company, how Arcadia is the best at what it does. But what it’s doing isn’t very exciting.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Wandering around outside for lil while, shower and dinner, then back out with siavash. Falafel and then waiting ages for him to finish - looking at magazines at CVS? thinking: be chill, but pretty inconsiderate right? I mean I’m here. you know i’m just getting toothpaste. Presumptive maybe.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The cage. These weird cage structures jutting from building that seem to have no functional or aesthetic reason for building. Maybe, drop your dog in a cage, shop a bit, get a coffee, and come pick up?</div>
<div>And the weird abandoned corner right in the middle of Davis Square (Davis Square Plaza). Old shops that shouldn’t exist: shoe repair, family practice. How are they affording rent? Joking about this as weird cheap grungy microcosm. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Let’s get a beer somewhere? No. Thought I was chiller.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>3/10</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Leaving work, 4:50. No end of day tiredness, transferable energy. To blog post? </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Bus demographics. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Crushing tickets. Somewhat focused. Maybe Albin's comments about passive learning having subtle impression?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Interview. Feeling clear and articulate, but also juvenile. Like I'm not the imposing authority I should be. Realizing that interviewers aren't always great at interviewing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Small complaints w Abhi: meeting at porter square station when heading to a game that is right past Davis square (left on Cam Ave). Ping pong: just generally good and a douchebag. And selectively counts.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Fuzzy face. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Anyway. Zach, in interview, saying how people at Arcadia are great. I mean nice/friendly, but uninspiring, uncreative.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Conversation last night w Siavash about directions to go with data. Siavash: creative, informed decision making. Me: creative visuals, art projects, medium of pursuing ideas.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At Nine Bar: what's this song? Deerhunter. Goes on to hipster snobbily recite all Deerhunter album names.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Pants feeling big.</div>
<div>Healthy food. Why ever eat shit like froyo? Slight relapse on an progress. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Morning commute. Beach house.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>New bike?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>3/11</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>leaving work and brutally efficient, though zen. upon arrival, biking 2 groceries. Bananas in hand, bag bursting, biking back. At home, cooking laundry, cleaning house, bathroom &amp; room in (mostly) anticipation of may. hm.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>stomachache.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>fragments as: when you catch yourself thinking. thinking what? is there consistency.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>earlier: </div>
<div>a ride back with kelsey. girls talks a lot. but nice, and, once in a while, enjoy just listening, seeing what’s going on in her transparent life.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>@work. intention to work on own JIRA dashboard. no no. caught in the ticket vacuum. stupid little issue with eye exam not showing up. turns out wrong join statement. but getting blog post out. i mean crushed tickets this week. wfh justified monday.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>getting high spiking thoughts, creativity, and ability to confront self.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>3/12</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>wow actually like daily diary.</div>
<div>yesterday, may in town.</div>
<div>pre-may, smoking. low blood sugar putting me in bed. feeling shitty about most things, a bit down, and like won’t be able to enjoy self this weekend. dramatic perhaps, may in, snapping out of it. chatting until like 2, then watching portlandia. bed after. nice.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>morning easy. morning: hanging with adam, showering. sun fueling trip to JP. w/ casey. </div>
<div>no background noise in brain.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>3/13</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>waking to the sound of: drums and bagpipes. boston.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>beautiful &amp; festive in davis square. 5k run, st. patrick’s day.</div>
<div>a bit of deja vu: yesterday, the arboretum trip ending in cafe. today, davis square sectioned off, vibrant. spending the day brunch-cooking like when home friends + noor here</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the air, gym (3 mi, minor lift) giddiness expelling sugar, substances from my body: motivating me to get clean. or more clean at least.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>brunch dominated day. up at 10 (happily letting daylight savings steal an hour). may slow, me doing pacing things. trip for pancake ingredients. and then second trip to nine bar. sun beaming. sunglasses justifiable. coffee, coffee beans. cooking, cooking like 11:30. pancakes materializing, eggs sitting in gooey, liquid form, waiting to materialize. may and i cooking, taking in mac demarco at first. after, just staring outside window. runners, bagpipes. cool air rushing in.</div>
<div>as usual, guests late to brunch. dana, aaron + casey, mat, allie, maggie. conversation focused on: eyebrows. among other things. like tests. weird vocabulary words. and cheating. cleaning, conversation, light laughter continuing to living room. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ah. ahhh. beautiful. calm.</div>
<div>sending may off at davis station. (during beach house show, weird thoughts of feeling close to / attracted to may).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>how to send rejection to pilar (tinder date was not into). by being honest. response, 'appreciate the reply, no worries'.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>**month and a half left before going home. do project, set something with product team. do something, do something. plan out next meeting w nick.</div>
<div>body: abs being carved out. cardio, feeling better, more fit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>siavash’s state: back pain, headaches. a relatively nonexistent form today, locked in room jamming while brunch happening.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Pleasant enough evening at Jesse's bday party. Talking to people. Sometimes thinking: what next, where's this conversation going? Do I have an out? Err :s. I would be less awkward if you're less awkward!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>3/14</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Ordinary ordinary day at work.</div>
<div>Little progress with priority dashboard. Stuck on issue w enter exit statement. Rectangles not added to selection?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Home, post-lift. Showering and starting to bite into food as Siavash and Pete alive. The hyper focus intimidating, but I have the energy. Talking about: the day, hot yoga, body deteriorating.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Oneohtrix. More like art gallery than concert. Ezra, the concert staple there.</div>
<div>Concert: narrow, high frequency range. Visuals, displayed on two vertically-oriented screens. At first</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>What is artist's relationship</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>3/15</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>morning ugh lil bit of dread b/c work. but showering lathering rubbing - and then drinking chugging. 6.5 hrs sleep not great but like feeling okay and deciding to tough out until lunch.</div>
<div>gloomy, rainy.</div>
<div>dragging feet along. today, not a fast commuter - watching people shuffle past me.</div>
<div>bus ride. windows misty. everyone queueing up like singaporeans. reading n y t briefing: russia/syria, myanmar aung, environmental factors = responsible for 1/4 of deaths, jellybooks = company tracking reading behavior. lil bit of reading about oneohtrix as well. walking in the office feeling ~educated.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>deployment monitoring basics done. but not that motivated to continue really. b/c like product support improvement be lame. various tickets, and writing script for deployment input. oh sick. oh sick.</div>
<div>meeting with nick around 5. shutting myself in conference room. storms in the brain.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>conversation with nick.</div>
<div>conveying plan: reports and extracts first, and keeping in loop with product team. (go over product roadmap). </div>
<div>spr-related (sir = ’sword in the stone’): doctors want to synthesize info. as in: don’t make recommendations. you can categorize and organize, but providers want to do the work. nick didn’t take approach of, say, putting meds, diagnoses, together. throwing out anomalous example of medication that may have influenced weight loss. all health factors need to be correlated with dx, medications.</div>
<div>picture of reports and extracts team as some data generalists. maybe a dude who is great with visuals, someone else who is great backend, etc etc.</div>
<div>a flow-y and relatively chill conversation otherwise. how nick got here: managing a large (5m) budget, and also creating something like ‘a day in the life of dr. jones’ as product. (tales of putting together prototype drunkenly in miami). point is, make some noise. make some noise. do something that gets in the product. this internal stuff - automation, team dashboard, etc, not gonna make a huge difference. </div>
<div>realizing the arcadia package deal: working outside work, living in boston, being in a relatively insipid atmosphere.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>~moneyinthebank (tax returns + salary)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Applied to start-up institute web design program. Web design or web dev - which am I interested in? Design seems to make more sense, always liked being on conceptualization side. (Still somewhat skeptical, would I learn better on my own? Or should I do part time? With 7k so justifiable, but other programs = mad difficult)</div>
<div>(Take a look at product roadmap and see if I can convince team to take investment on me? Bold)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>With Abhi talking about: how Arcadia is in best position for healthcare. Can be part of real change. But: do I want healthcare? Industry that is slow, behind. </div>
<div>However: unprecedented opportunity to do real UX here..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>3/15</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Reading about interest. Rate rises when economy is doing well. Suppose it makes sense at surface, don't truly understand. Clinton/trump leading by strong margin. Al Qaeda making comeback in Africa near Ivory Coast.</div>
<div>Scrolling through nytimes, looking at data visuals like: hm I think this is (sort of) what I want to do.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Work: blog post 2, bootstrap, and SPR.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>3/16</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Work was ? I think just okay. Need to really at least work debrief. If I wanna get places.</div>
<div>Many thoughts of ~broad ambitions, life, and best way to achieve them. Design for analysis dilemma. Yesterday tending to analysis but today design (partly because gap in Arcadia, and how fun).</div>
<div>
<div>Last night. Email from Alyssa - positive feedback for blog post. Nick: thx for roadmap visualization feedback, comprehensive/hurts so good.</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Yesterday post-work: brain not really shutting off. Consistently awake.</div>
<div>A joint like at midnight, spark of creativity, good banter (jokes of: Armenian girl (name?) who we found on fb photo of tinder girl, waiting and swooning over ‘vash). </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>3/17</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Early to work, Americano on way (deciding drip coffee = way2go). Academy presentation - relatively good. Upbeat, right level of abstraction. Only downside = demo absence (no big). </div>
<div>Scrambling sort of day. Doing deployments, checking on stuff - this neighborcare issue (missing data oh em em). And prepping/doing phone interview (starting to grasp). Interesting exercise in: how to develop most comprehensive picture of someone in least amount of time. Next will go well, methinks.</div>
<div>Ping pong. On fire/surprising self. Why am I so streaky?</div>
<div>Company meeting. Weird and culty. CTO, natural speaker, starting with 'I'm a dataholic. I use prescription date etc etc'. Somewhat funny,  recited so naturally. (Leadership: love to talk about selves). New COO bob Walton talking about every single job he has had over 30 years. And voice from a new hire: pure propaganda of how she loves this family and what ‘we do’ when bitch u ain’t been here a minute (24 days). Then, HIMSS. ‘We were so great’ paraphrased in many ways. Nobody go deep in this data like we do. (A shoutout to everyone involved in data gallery, missing me until Alyssa brightly chimes in). Care management aspect is missing. Any competitors of note? Nothing said, long pause, until finally someone mentions IBM ~1billion dollar investment in healthcare. Rly?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Tomorrow: startup institute interview, call with rob (also need to grab Steve and quickly throw out fact that I want to switch teams).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Teasing apart my indecisiveness and resume. indecisiveness or natural attraction to many different things (or same thing)?</div>
<div>How having unapologetic attitude allows one to process previous actions with meaning. that is, deduce some element of personality, and work with these previous actions.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Lately eating fast and sort of restless. not that many pretzels/gum tho, and somewhat focused/productive otherwise. so maybe just eating fast. Vision is in my mind lately. future and ambitions film playing in my head, and also - the direct: what am i doing, i can easily pick up new shit and disrupt disrupt and why am i crushing tickets no one even notices?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Shit I’m turning 23 i’mma get old quick. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Back to the house. A mini joint with Adam - talking about St. Patrick’s / night with Armenians (from Tinder). ‘Vash and I bailing. Then vash showing email about analysis of # reviews and how they influence sails / trust factor (user return rate).</div>
<div>(seeing how brilliant man like cash fucked up a bit and sent email where everyone was thinking same rebuttal. be open-minded to ways of thinking: smart men can make deep insights but miss something relatively obvious. in this case, not that higher-reviewed products sell more, but that higher-quality products sell more. also, how delicate, arbitrary the production and analysis process is. Even if brilliant, without prod in the right direction you going downhill, you know?)</div>
<div>And interview prep. Among Deerhunter, Radiohead, lil shuffle, and tinder swipes. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I want a girl.</div>
<div>(Scrolling through Jade’s instagram like damn everything is beautiful and artsy why did I let her goo)</div>
<div><br/></div>

<en-note>
	<div>lately</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>3/18 - 3/19</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>career stuff:</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>a day of ~career thoughts</div>
	<div>post startup institute interview. focused on life ambitions really, not much grilling about technical skills. after asking what i’ve been up to, stopping me at travel bit. and really getting sense of what i want in job/life.</div>
	<div>then talking about the program - how does that sound to you?</div>
	<div>perfect, i say back. playing to the method of the program, somewhat naturally. because, though culty, values and ambitions of this program do resonate with me.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>and thinking: why continue to be deviant, outlier, and fight to carve niche (re: arcadia) when i can just join a startup, move to NY? stop being a deviant and be around inspiring people. </div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>drawing mind map of creative + logical goals. paths / factors leading incl. business savvy + data science + data viz, or data viz + front-end + UX. do i need a fundamental basis in software for these routes? likely not. courses in UX + data science, or UX + front-end dev can be enough. though fundamental background may make me pick up on this quicker.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>articulating to casey. first desire. second startup program. then what’s been on at work: opportunity on product that may or may not be in horizon, switch to reports and how long it’s taken. </div>
	<div>….</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>3/18:</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>back home. cooking w/ adam (bok choy ahoy). how does weed affect you? how was your day? what was going out with armenian from tinder like? </div>
	<div>broad city for a bit, online shopping. vash a bit bothered (previous night: slightly high conversation about insecurities, different spins and philosophizing what might be driving this. and also: therapy. would it help?), craving outing. drinks? nah. eventually, suggesting to meditate. everyone on board. 15 minutes going by quickly. debrief. meditation is hard, can see background noise in head etc etc. my background noise: career things i’ve been thinking about, girls, imagined interactions?, family + gifts. nothing surprising really.</div>
	<div>walking for like 1.5 hours. at davis, seeing T like: wanna hop in? alewife or central? to alewife. walking around station, parkouring on sculptures, commenting on public art. (earlier: davis square masked statues. interactions between three statues baffling. creepy masked baby as well). slightly injuring self running up steep triangular platform. worth it. (what a wuss, slight bruise now big deal)</div>
	<div>the usual g talk, slang, and jokes derived from distorting speech, infusing with g sort of dialect. </div>
	<div>through the cookie cutter apartment complex on cambridgepark drive. depressing in a geometrical way.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>at work:</div>
	<div>frustrating, mind racing. chpw care issue. fucked up, and sent out diagnosis of source data missing. reality: we switched queries for no good reason. correcting - thankfully in the morning, before work. still: early meeting at work with steve. a bit patronizing, feeling like i’m at principals office. but taking ownership, explaining how and why i handled this situation so poorly. sending out report to explain what went wrong. (at least more stimulating than normal day).</div>
	<div>convo with rob pearson about switching teams. about 2 min long: but gist was: we really need people, let’s get everyone in a room and talk about this. okay that’s sort of good.</div>
	<div>career life trajectory carving niche etc</div>
	<div>plan to stay late and work. tapping out at 4:30 - to alewife, trader joe’s, and home.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>3/19</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>radiohead. kid a -&gt; in rainbows.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>morning: half-shot of espresso -&gt; gym. feeling it. 3 mile run, with deerhunter through 10 min = great state of mind. appreciating sobriety night prior, clear, motivated state of mind. home and large breakfast, talking to mom pops. </div>
	<div>taking my time. showering, browsing for gifts.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>the weekends. like i’m different person. positive, clear, logical, quick, and creative. it’s beautiful it’s beautiful and i want my life to be like this.</div>
	<div>easy chat with adam - rocking cool, pocket-exposed pants (making think: luv fashion). and vash. in good mood (give me a hug). oh vash. the typical saturday morning question posed.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>we’re talking about: objectification and what it means and whether porn is always objectification.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>dropping siavash off, stop at nine bar for his cappuccino. running into casey on the way. and running into: jimmy and electrical engineering gf (both brown engineers) there. to diesel. game of pool, talking about casey’s prior night, plan for evening. and music, music.</div>
	<div>walk to home. cooking and: song exploder podcast. kelela talking about process in making Rewind. really hearing story behind every layer in song. how complicated it is, miami bass vision, the aesthetic kelela tried to create. earl sweatshirt over our lunch, and some friendly food criticism. girl at brown casey is pursuing, trying to decipher message (don’t wanna date but wanna hang out). = let’s be friends, or let’s potentially be friends and hook up?</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>casey talking about allie. (in 3 min conversation, from alewife to davis - half of brain listening, other half like please speak faster are we gonna get to a conclusion before davis). allie: soloed with gf in immature way. (going to room, not even to hook up, just to chill, when casey is there). realizing that i was this person at some point.</div>
	<div>****value: always always remember and hold onto mistakes, inefficiencies. depression, sticking with stef, general poor decision making. resentment towards parents, family. religiousness and non-religiousness. remember. remember the exact thought processes. </div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Retro from 3/22:</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>3/20</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Long talk w Stef</div>
	<div>Pessimism and radiohead </div>
	<div>Focus and ganj</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>3/21</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Low spirits, up thinking of work.</div>
	<div>But: snow, work from home.</div>
	<div>Diesel afternoon: listening to conversation/interciew about healthcare data tech company. 'Sorry to interrupt, but I work in healthcare tech and your company sounds fascinating'. Thought dissipating as I pick cold coffee up, pack laptop, and head home for lunch. (Baby wandering, couple or friends sitting across from each other and not really conversing).</div>
	<div>Lifting. Thinking about body. It's okay but need to get rid of back fat/obtain more prominent abs. And more deadlift, weighted squat. (At least incline on fleek - 155 lbs 3 reps). And a good 15 pull up set (grip makes diff).</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Shift upward in spirits. Causes: sunlight, moving from administrative work to actual project (deployment discrepancy auto detection), presiding over this chpw care issue.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>CHPW care = best learning experience on product support so far.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Intelligent sounding message from tinder girl about opinion on Myers-Briggs tests.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Long face solidarity: thinking while watching fb vid of Arab dude with long face. Not the only one - not the only one.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Talking to Adam about: career, therapy session, distraction.</div>
	<div>Winter and spring in a day.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Product Roadmap review, then stretching to Nico Jaar. Sleep.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>3/22</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Rich morning - long shower, lil coffee, pb banana coco on stale bread. Nytimes daily briefing.</div>
	<div>Siavash up, emerging like mummy (white blanket wrapping body, protecting from tighty whitey). Reciting email from cool former boss who is VP of some finance fund. Talking about his: belief that life outside work has given him confidence and self-assurance in career even in low points, brief trip to Iran, happy Persian new year. Overall thoughtful, lengthy, earnest response. Mentorship: something people crave? Thinking while trying to sidecomb hair.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Feeling the focus.</div>
	<div>Dope less full of focus</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Bible/related book 'Masters at subduing spouses'. And OCaml/gaming related coding. Over the edge of the world. New Yorker. (Fader fort outfits). Economist. The rest donning headphones, dull stares. (Express bus = 100 pct working class)</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>It's like: just rock.</div>
	<div>— retro</div>
	<div>work? i don’t know. antsy. </div>
	<div>home. walking in same time as ‘vash. walking - ending up in porter. saying ‘hey, wanna get kale’. turns into full-fledged grocery trip - mind oscillating between ‘fuck this dude can be so inconsiderate taking up my time’ and ‘hey this is kinda fun look i know some stuff about groceries’.</div>
	<div>siavash (self-involved) talking to me and i’m into it. focused state of mind but not minding something else - conversation to focus on. distraction, ostensibly. </div>
	<div>reviewing product roadmap a little. </div>
	<div>stretch, tim hecker, sleep.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>3/23</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>can one have self awareness of depression when depressed?</div>
	<div>(Re: article about the weeknd, how people have tried and failed to replicate sound of that quality )</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>How can an article about bus timing, delays extend for 5 min? How do you transition out? By talking about mechanical bus failures. Bus been beeping for a min. Driver getting in on the banter.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>zoning out, tuning out (weekend, nytimes, fader)</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>lately on</div>
	<div>~health kick (pretty good workout, though body / joints a bit destroyed)</div>
	<div>morningly on a </div>
	<div>~the weekend house of balloons kick</div>
	<div>after reading article about how influential / unsustainable this fucked up partying all night r&amp;b drug</div>
	<div>and beach house sample (master of none) whut whut.</div>
	<div>head bob popping swaying as i</div>
	<div>walk into the office, headphones off.  sensual, synth, slow, atmospheric layers replaced with - light chatter. clicks. clacks. posture readjustments.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>work</div>
	<div>----</div>
	<div>at work like sort of actively pissed</div>
	<div>the check in meeting with steve, where i drop the ‘yo i’m trying to move’ news. he respect it not gonna wreck. but cautions against including this as a third bullet point (of three, yes sir, third of three) in an email. when magnitude is greater.</div>
	<div>really? in my head saying snarkily, but out loud like ‘ermm not gonna drop the news unless i know a move is possible, don’t wanna seem 2 eager to leave’. but then recovering and saying, well knowing your management style i suppose i should have known..</div>
	<div>‘these things talk a while’</div>
	<div>impulsive defense mechanism - digging for some sort of mom joke or easy insult involving taking a while.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>a phone interviews. was too easy and retroactively deciding to reject candidate. can’t give too much leeway. </div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>ping pong lately weird like ball weird or something</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>status checks like all day at work. but got this deployment status update table up at least?</div>
	<div>---</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>my world is digital</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>phife dawg dead shit</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>dvsn r&amp;b. a bit too stripped down.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>back home and the air is like different everything is lifted and i feel chill and i cook and shower and watch broad city and ahh </div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>3/24</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>last night late night keef particle exploration</div>
	<div>evaluating mental state</div>
	<div>a bit groggy in morning (washed away in morning steam). but not same motivation for work, zest for morning (yay yay tunes nytimes)</div>
	<div>but like maybe unrelated</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>and</div>
	<div>work was 2 interviews, 1 good 1 bad. sharp and ready to take apart bad one, but mind not feeling probing in second and panicking and then chilling. tamar.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>and 'high priority' issues that are lame as fuck and how i don't really respect..</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>speedboat on the bus, speeding through it getting stuff and skimming because mind skims when i've read things</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>thinking about: detail orientation. i'm not detail-oriented and don't really want to be. i decided. like want to focus but geez this dude zach like oh wait you used icd10 code and not 9 how surprising and like dude you really focusing on that like</div>
	<div><br/></div>

Product roadmap and looking into courses. Part time looking unsatisfying. Proposal: leave work for 3 months? Is that crazy?</div><div>Only gripes: maybe I just need to know stuff to visualize a la Simon? Real depth not required? But desire to visualize hardcore..Second gripe: money. But getting deep education without paying + just rent and living (~6k), will likely have to loan? Overall seems like good choice.</div><div>Fulfilling socialization - Angela in the morning, tacos then coffee, and after: reef. Siavash tagging along. Conversation veering towards music, religion, life updates. Progressing in sort of standard way, but proper listening and consideration etc</div><div>Dvsn simple unfiltered r&amp;b</div><div><br /></div><div>3/28</div><div><br /></div><div>Restless pseudo sleep (blame espresso shot at 4pm). Thugga in the morning to lift to.</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Why not just walk to alewife?</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Day at work dull dull. No real meetings (acp acting as tech lead okay that's nice ish) and just busting through usual tickets. Lame lame.</div><div>And then lunch w Steve, new hire Harsh, Pranav, Wendong. Dry conversation, dreary air recalling my first few days here. Did I even pretend to appear enthusiastic? Lunch with Josh and Alex, dryly like what's up here's what's up with team where are you from but like  not that into wanting to know me know me as a person.</div><div>Quirky quirky people on the bus</div><div>Wearing new green oversized shirt.

<div>writing from work @ work checking the clock to get outta work when will i leave and get outta work i don't like this work do i wanna work when will i like work what work should i do how will i work what works for me and family but me mainly me but there's also money so what works, what really works?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>okay.</div>
<div>yesterday a deep dive into : data science vs software. and the lingering design strategy dreams.</div>
<div>realizing that data science is: a buzzword, and, largely corporate.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work today. unstimulating. deployments. </div>
<div>unashamedly restless. working on own stuff. up and about for no reason. reading article about kaytranada's depression, coming out. and writing this. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>circling back to data science v. software engineering convo - understanding whatiwant what i really really want. data science, software, design. that's it. (and the 6 permutations of combos)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Ya boy poops</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at night. the sharp and clear minded but not really wanting to use my brain type feeling. the wanting to smoke but others not down so not smoking type feeling. last hour or so before bed, occupied w music. </div>
<div>jokes, mostly, with the boys.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>4/6</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work: drudgery. nice 30 min of brainstorming elderly health analysis, and realizing that this is a real project. medium for results. cool i suppose. also: retirement plan meeting. watching myself watch the bright lights, oily pizza, salesman-like demeanor. outdate, poorly made presentation. today: carrying some anger. but: meeting with gleeson tomorrow + innovation day. laying down what i want from this meeting. laying it down. i'm laying it down bitch, demands or i'm out.</div>
<div>observations: team. after conv with siavash about micromanagement realizing ste = deadbeat, useless deadbeat.</div>
<div>clarity in: arcadia being uninspiring: pave the path to product or out.</div>
<div>(written from work)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at home. cooking, showering, smoking (first little, then little pt II) and zoning, zoning in. mixing CMYK, shabazz. mapping to pads. productive, would say.</div>
<div>(continue working with this track, but then work knob up, instrument up. truly understand things)</div>
<div>motivation to create create. and music as avenue for understanding my creative process and addressing weaknesses. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>music - ash koosha. experimental glitchy ambient (persian). blood orange. morning walk - sun beautiful beaming and blood orange imparting slight bounce to steps. and then next blood orange album (done w first) oo man distorted guitar i’m vibing vibing. feeling clear. looking at alewife station in different angles, kicking around ball of unseasonal snow. also valentin stip, beautiful sample of athan woven into eerie track.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>body. it fluctuates and i’m okay with that. thinking today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>4/7</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>words of the day:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>craft, purposeful.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>     craft: mentioned many times in conversation with gleeson. a step-by-step, first broad, and slowly narrowing conversation. what do you want in your career? impressively orchestrated            conversation. using diagram (axes of creative &amp; logical) as starting point. the ux component of work not available at arcadia. the ui/front-end dev = mainly engineering. and the nick-like role overlapping with d3. and saying my goal is to hone craft, become really good at visualization and analysis. talking about avenues for this in arcadia.</div>
<div>ending with possibility of: taking 2 months for data visualization, and then product team internship. really a best case..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>     purposeful, how i feel.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>foray into podcasts.</div>
<div>this american life - ‘you’ll understand when you grow up’. diff phases of life, how you cannot see until you’re in that phase. ending with old age, alzheimers, having to rebuild basic ideas like reading clock (which really is, so complex and unintuitive)..beautiful, some semblance of tears almost forming.</div>
<div>contextualizing own growth and maturity w podcast.</div>
<div>podcasts as: conversations, company. loneliness dissipating.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in news: panama papers scandal (rich people + tax evasion)</div>
<div>removing all mental blocks, all barriers that prevent me from doing. just do it do it and if it really really doesn’t feel good after a while don’t do it. </div>
<div>rain beating, but state of mind positive, so feeding into inspiration, extra texture noise and inspiration.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>4/9 </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>justify why i’m doing what i’m doing..</div>
<div>i mean - i need to tell myself that i will be good at data visualization and really really let myself delve into it and explore it. don’t let confidence, self-classification hinder this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today - feeling insular. not entirely bad.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>podcasts. a new thing. interesting form of: company. w/ dinner, like a friend. or like two friends, one of which you know super well, the other not so much, both talking about home or professions or some subject that you’re alien to but interested in. so you sit there, rapt. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home after night out in union. rolling a joint from remnants. mainly tobacco. halfway through, deciding - this isn’t worth it. putting everything away. retreating.</div>
<div>night out w/ architects. angela. friend christina from az (cute), katie and johannes (married architects), and guy from zambia? johannes, extended conversation about swiss politics. zambian dude, basic life-in-boston type questions.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>with conversation - what to do when they end? are others equally apprehensive? pacing sitting waiting staring, thinking should i ask general thing about this person b/c i don’t know them and i can just endlessly ask question or is that too obvious should i just stand and get into another convo but the other convo is going and not so inclusive so i’m gonna kind of lean in an maybe lean out, take a sip of my drink, but then go back in, back in, maybe there’s a pause, some eye contact, and invite, okay there isn’t there isn’t. bathroom? no too obvious. paralyzed socially. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a reply on tinder from monet. infp girl, conversation starter about personality types (intelligent reply). went overboard and sent long (lengthiness not justified by intelligence - relatively normal reply). but then - hey, didn’t mean to make you feel weird by not replying. wow. let’s do something. shocka flocka flame.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home with ~me.</div>
<div>earlier today: doing some data work at forge (early, there by 9). sun out, motivated, optimistic with world, ambitions, and many breads (did not realize bread plate is so large) ahead of me. home and cooking chatting to adam, shower, you know. cleaning, laundry, more data pseudo work, podcasts, and days flows by into evening..</div>

<div>Escalator elevation, perfect posture.</div>
<div>(note taken, watching</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<div>4/12</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>What is global economic growth? Aggregated chaos?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Word of day = sugary</div>
<div>and sneer. sneering. sneering all day.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Are you virtually clean?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I stretch a lot</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>--workfromwork</div>
<div>dull. today dull. morning, energy. fighting grey, rainy day mentally. documenting scripts and thinking 'guess i accomplished a bit, beyond the job description'. post lunch, swimming in tickets. and onto sprint review. cringing internally at jokes, comments, sneering skeptically at exclamatory remarks. sneering. and insulted - in minor way - that none of my improvements (minus the idea of the dashboard, which was steve's) have been documented! deployment script option in connectorStudio, but not my my script ('deployment script FIELD' rather than automation). and table. and reports. and thinking of how stifling this env is - where people never talk about context, broad picture, company movement, what we’re doing, ideas for improvement like what if we ran out of tickets - do we have innovative ideas waiting for us? path of least resistance propelling us forward.</div>
<div>launchpad demo. skeptical. muy skeptical - how they sell that? can use any generic task management tool really.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Just let it linger</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>path of least resistance propelling us forward.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>from work. channeling frustration into high volume. flipping through albums, settling on explosions. need to listen more. but sharper sound. like cathartic. hm</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking about: boredom</div>
<div>and loneliness. as not the absence of people but uniformity in state of mind + lack of intimacy. but is intimacy contingent on the human touch? i suppose</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i interview myself a lot</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Home and</div>
<div>Talking to myself mentally. Ableton synth sounds, nice reverberating sort of intro sound. Vash walking in - work talk. Ableton + social back and forth. Friendly thread with jade - going to Alex G? Nanah, but like maybe she still sees me somewhat positively?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>4/13</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Morning oddly not too sharp though good sleep</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Finding weird metrics </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>4/14</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>On the job writing is weird but I'm doing it.</div>
<div>Mid interview with Mr. Derek Caroll. Astronomy physics major. </div>
</div>
<div>(Happily) unproductive day at work. Jittery (caffeinated) med finger infection check up - pleasant, somewhat scatterbrained masculine  doc, diverting conversation to shoes that avoid shin splints. Lyft 2 work, nytimes as company. (Deployments, lunch, ping pong, interview, lil work, and gallery talk).</div>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>On the job writing - form of gauging consciousness, creativity, state of mind, straightforward, event driven.</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div>Data visual categorization </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>4/15</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lately lately. like last weekend, this week, sober. and continuity, stability. at least past couple days.</div>
<div>the new james blake ‘timeless’ like kind of a head banga. like more dance y high-pitched sounds broke free, took over mr. blake’s tracks.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>earlier: a lil back n forth with jade mainly revolving around ‘going to alex g?’ but with a lil banter of my weird voicemail / disappearing. and some lament on being able to see me at show. and thesis due soon. damn. would like 2 see her.</div>
<div>girls: monet from tinder, a potential date this weekend?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(work)</div>
<div>snippet: drive back from work today. sunny, breezy, energetic air. talkative, social, talking to abhi about french friends, french girl, partying, potential tinder date. a tit for tat, that, as usual, doesn’t go explores just beneath the surface. and kanye, of course. likening to kendrick? and using word ‘jazz ensemble’ too often. i’m too hard on people.</div>
<div>snippet II: at work, over lunch, conversation about food leading to craft in food (jiro dreams). explaining interest in movie at cursory level, and not getting passion across. or more: communicating, in diluted way, my thoughts. but the emotions not there, and all of a sudden thoughts + growth + learning from movie feeling delegitimized. </div>
<div>iii: making lil report about deployments that were lost in shuffle (not promotion action marked). first - like whoa steve chill stop being so grave for silly things like this like i mean people would have checked on it if it were more important. but the point, the point is: steve talking all the credit, really, sending out email to big shots and crediting me in a ‘PS’ line. could have been like: ;omar put together an analysis showing that x’. like dude.</div>
<div>iv: recapping interviews. someone who aced it, but a bit business douchey. and well: coating this in level of professionalism (good and bad aspects to personality). thinking about personality assessment in companies...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home &amp; 538 data podcast - political data. move from targeted ads back to canvassing, growth in sophistication occurring like 2004. other important things.</div>
<div>focusing reading lately on: tufte, nytimes daily briefing + podcast, and data visuals. a keen eye, taste, must develop. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking: should i try going out alone this weekend? and imagining, at the bar. just standing. and maybe turning to start a conversation. hey. hello. hey, how is your night? or. hey i’m omar. what do you do? i do this. okay cool i do this. hm. why do you do that. why do you like that? oh really. yea i can see that. because this one time i did this one thing that isn’t really related to what you’re saying but i’m fumbling desperately to keep this conversation because you’re cute and maybe a little cool and this is going to go nowhere but at least it will be less embarrassing and i can feel like something real was transmitted if i continue to dig, to fumble.</div>
<div>echoing conversation with siavash: how conversations = no more circular bullshit pseudo thoughts. things must be grounded in some logic to be able to transmit. is that the difficulty here. am i being lazy in not socializing? like mentally lazy. because i’m a person with thoughts and thoughts to share and interested in other thoughts but like i don’t wanna wanna you can’t make me do that and talk to people.</div>
<div>thoughts of: brooklyn for the summer. subletting room here.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>recurring:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style="margin-left:40px;">sentiment today: i’m narcissistic (most people are) and won’t not be until having kids? and having kids.</div>
<div style="margin-left:40px;">thinking about kids lately and wow so far from that. so far. should i even have kids. i think so. but time time time.</div>
<div style="margin-left:40px;"><br/></div>
<div style="margin-left:40px;">how little is revealed to myself - in terms of concrete events - through this journal. because concrete events: like 3 months off for vacation + data vis, and switch to product team, is culmination of hours of thought anxiety, self exploration. but maybe mentioned once or twice here? or: clear glasses. constantly evaluating fit on face, person feel, etc. and shin splints. really dominant. but here, sprinkled.</div>
<div style="margin-left:40px;"><br/></div>
<div>     thoughts of arabism and when will i find time to practice language and be like an arab date.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>     going on dates with myself lately. talking about my life after graduation. or what i think of my job. things like that. it’s weird i guess this is loneliness.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>     idea of -distilling people/personality to short statements. collecting background noise document - but maybe should focus</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>     ‘what do i do tonight: music or data visualization or reading or buying things? or socializing?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lo fi grimes appropriate in self brooding, ready to start mixing days like this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now. let’s get my mind off me..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>4/16</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>diesel. chatter turning into a sonic slur. position poorly chosen, cannot overhear specific conversations and feel inspired, connected to people i don't know.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Looking a bottle of something, reading a book of something, laughing at something, listening to something. Staring at something. The subway.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>One couple replacing the next. Flash forward 15 years, a few haircuts, and a further detachment from trends.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>People being replaced on the subway. A weird phenomenon.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Questions:</div>
<div>At what point (quantity) does personal data become meaningful?</div>
<div>To what extent does structure limit phenomoelogy?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Emotional q more interesting, above general</div>
<div>Like conveying emotion </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ideas about</div>
<div>Maps and charts -- no no</div>
<div>Music</div>
<div>My own writing </div>
<div>Music during story (synth </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Represent myself / interest through data visuals </div>
<div>Like timeline with disciplines = anti disciplinarian </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Armenian school event. Remembering why lectures don't work. Velvet tracksuit</div>
<div>Religion discussion, data oogling. Delving into data art. Like manually logging text. Incredible - tho like why not learn code.</div>
<div>Then interviews, book reviews.</div>
<div>All while adjusting query, waiting for run.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Toy synth and material guilt</div>
<div>Pete over and sort of a militant sinister joking mood </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>4/17</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Nine bar. The first time: decisive. Matcha order</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Patchwork.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Running queries. Gym - debate</div>
<div>Real friends?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Waiting on vashh</div>
<div>Plant</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(retrospective 4/19)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>incredibly peaceful sunday. </div>
<div>earlier, coffee then plant shopping with siavash. taking his sweet sweet time shopping for personal plant. after having waited already to get coffee, irritated - and deciding whether or not to be irritated. should i ever actually be irritated? or like always fight that since. good way to live, but doesn’t lead to justice.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>but two cycles of: nine bar. the first: decisive, matcha order. the word ‘patchwork’ ringing in my head, writing down. siavash asking if displayed sweet is a ‘real’ macaroon - and eventually orders it with cappuccino. vanishes in a couple minutes, as i’m sipping gently on matcha, observing sunshine, activity. clad in: clear glasses, faded joggers, boots, hat. looking like a spectacle, i realize whenever i view myself externally. finishing tufte book, heading to plants.</div>
<div>the second: fresh from gym, shower, craving bout of socialization (texting angela, but in ny, calling jackie, mike answering on behalf: going climbing). trotting on, tufte book in hand. representing this new focused me. this new data artist me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>other things - analyzing, sitting in roundabout park. observing kids, many kids, throughout day. vivid images of parents, imagining their lives, life changing after parenting, and like wow shit not much time to do crazy creative things. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>feeling fulfilled and somewhat creative, but in a very confined box. craving socialization not really because of intimacy (apart from girls, need dat) but mainly creative perspective. i think. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i’m starting to use the word ‘i’ in my journal. what does that mean? change of writing, or in personal philosophy. </div>
<div><br/></div>

<en-note>
<div>4/18 &amp; 4/19 (b/c sort of similar):</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on 4/18: workfromwork (because why work?)</div>
<div>channeling positive grounded energy from yesterday (warmth, focus) into today. metrics of: not snacking, eating compulsively, general self-des</div>
<div>meaning - full day of work, feeling relatively awake, not incredibly bored, and not frustrated. ++. morning = usual deployment bs (transitioning when?), afternoon, popped out script to populate daily priorities.</div>
<div>lunch. warm. outside. data vis book on lap, wind shutting pages, telling me. stop, take this moment, chill.</div>
<div>work: focused, though bored. but focused, productive. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>after hearing siavash’s concern about ‘tongue posture’ cannot help but reevaluate facial and jaw structure, constantly flex jaw and force up. but like don’t even know if tongue posture is bad. just getting obsessive compulsive about recurring obsessive thing: teeth and mouth and overall appearance. 4/19 too - though additional perspective of: with recent mental clarity, groundedness, let’s see how i can deal with obsessive thinking?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>body pain lately. feet shins. mainly bottom right foot bone.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>walk home from alewife. trees. also, tangential thinking. seeing two 30ish year olds playing soccer, one wearing jersey with ‘son’ written. and then imagining how some people likely construct sexual fantasies in which one person is son, other father or something? people are weird but really i’m weird.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this inventions album - maze of woods - beautiful, awakening me, almost tearing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home today has been - energetic flurry of cooking eating. shower, heat, draining body of energy. talking to siavash about how he ‘fucked up’ - jokingly agreed with coworker’s statement that he is terrible storyteller. like not that bad. constructing apology: calling coworker about ballet recital (mutual interest), inviting, and slipping in ‘by the way, sorry for that comment, dry sense of humor’. well crafted.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>craft.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>4/22</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>empty. whirr of cars. humidity, smell, feel. brain, body, emptied in shower. appetite replenished, coconut &amp; walnut. energy, recharging, tea awaiting. no desire.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today - and yesterday too - negative thought loops. this one of getting fired? and being angry at work? but like sort of leaving with dignity. well that one, over and over. and me being lonely loner. and then other - a girl. some girl. some well semblance, outline of a girl of an interaction with a girl. these things.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday. helvetica. the documentary. typography - imagining the meticulous design process. and diary = helvetica. i suppose its neutrality = good for this purpose? interesting bit about how words like ‘angry’ written in helvetica, for example, don’t say angry. expressive type. grunge type. this circular movement in typography, immersion in helvetica, and return sort of. some designers loving constraint, others bored bored bored like it’s been done and exhausted.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>stability and sobriety. thoughts lately. how it sort of sucks. like 3 weeks no smoking. brain stabilizing, not erratic. thoughts relatively controlled. mood emotional sometimes, but in controlled range. and this is boring. but the focus, cultivating the focus. depth requires focus. though feeling like creativity dwindles when narrowing interests.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>spring imposing a different, wakeful state of mind. like hyperaware of self, of position in life. logical, suppose. like more clearly marks passage of time. but the smell, the urge, seduction to be carefree, young, go outside, be social, immerse yourself in the world. this this making me feel aware of surrounding, aware of my relationship to surrounding (alone, sort of weirdo in clear glasses, etc), my relationship to world, identity, things..</div>
<div>too literal.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>foot shin pain recurring. don’t stop from balling. somerville courts near union square. patchwork of people. white, tatted dude in cargo pants, hat, mercedes chain (ripped off of car?) saying hi to fit dad. sort of beautiful. but conversation largely sports - describing exact seat at game - and saying platitude and sport cliches, though earnestly. society melding and it’s nice. shots not falling.</div>
<div>lately the most touching music. inventions, maze of woods. little ambient, weird uttering voices - but just enchanting, transporting, transportive.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>when living is natural. like desire really maybe greatest desire is for life to my natural. for no transitions to be felt. for whims and impulses to overlap with actual life schedule.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>4/24 - saturday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>various personal data / journal data project ideas (-&gt; expand)</div>
<div>hersh and yahya. recalling last time - dull, hazy, too much weed. this time, banter, laughter, just enough weed.</div>
<div>outside for moments, listening to explosions in the sky album, staring at sky. frisbee whirring nearby, in baseball feed.</div>
<div>mixing mixing music though back to start of chopped shabazz from yesterday</div>
<div>smoking and like feeling shabazz so damn hard</div>
<div>voices voices laughing so hard i’m crying.</div>
<div>ice cream stop stop at cvs. </div>
<div>siavash playing classical music. not exactly the right vibe.</div>
<div>harsh, glad in yellow polo shirt, blazer, jeans, brogue type shoes.</div>
<div>shoes on my feet feel weird - small now but big earlier?</div>
<div>haircut. it’s okay, a bit too thick on the front.</div>
<div>dancing in cvs</div>
<div>jamming extremely hard to explosions with harsh and getting emotional</div>
<div>back to the house a haze, snacking (ice cream), some tunes (classical music err?), preceded however by young thug oh yes. </div>
<div><br/></div>

<en-note>How redundancy leaves room for others to learn

	
	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	
	<div>Weird sort of jarring movements</div>

	<div>The right level of abstraction makes things interesting.</div>

	
	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	
	<div>Lists of what people do in a place</div>

	
	
	<div>In a coffee shop: sipping, checking (lists, cars), staring, typing. 'Internal to product'</div>

	
	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	
	<div>fresh off: game of thrones episode w/ julia. some narrative transportation (urge to google this word, subsiding, deciding against odd impulse / distraction). tragedy unabated, hand on julia’s leg, and tempted tempted but like not gonna happen. </div>

	
	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	
	<div>feeling too grounded, plain routine. smoke as solution. but 10pm, joint roll = process. restraint in picturing myself smoking, not really really in indulging in act.</div>

	
	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	
	<div>thinking of: constructing the murder story julia is reading. how author’s process reliant on gradual accumulation</div>

	
	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	
	<div>oh right julia over. low-key. early bed, in alternation, so not much time together. though today. easy, pleasant, light.</div>

	<div>Coffee cup in hand, unbuttoning pants</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Ignorance leading to overconfidence. Cannot answer errors </div><div>What am I incompetent at? </div><div><br/></div><div>Podcasts: in defense of ignorance. Echoing siavash's grandmother, not telling of terminal illness. Julia holter. Beautiful expansive noise. Dunning-kruger effect, incompetence leading to overconfidence. </div><div><br/></div><div>Adaptable adaptable.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Record own voice?

5/4 - Doha

	
	
	</div><div><br /></div><div>Brain in a not feeling it mood.</div><div>Tired, morning. Groggy stretches while waiting for Noor. Breakfast, lavish. Talking - well listening really - to conversation on my left: mama, Noor, Ahmed's mom. Graduation logistics, kids, daily matters. To right: Ahmed's dad. Cultural differences (America vs here, Americans have saying called 'what goes around comes around', greater sense of civic duty). Kuwait and Qatar similarity, issues with urban planning in gulf. Me, silent vacant, though, sharp, attentive.</div><div><br /></div><div>Taking yousuf to room, restless. Summer occupied by kindle, burning through books. Room. Sunny spacious. Forcing yousuf to read. difficulty channeling positive encouragement with reading, after repeated instances of lying (most blatant: on page 100 after like 20 minutes, with no idea of what happened in book).</div><div><br /></div><div>Cornell grad</div><div>+dinner</div><div><br /></div><div>5/5 </div><div><br /></div><div>Musings and observations about baba and family. Frustration no longer unfiltered, coated in behavioral pattern observation.</div><div><br /></div><div>At once more distanced and connected to culture. Distance brings keen observation, interest. Which can be aggregated, synthesized, processed emotionally - leading to connection, intimacy. Interesting (at least superficially 'a not paradoxical paradox type of thing)</div><div><br /></div><div>5pm dinner turning to 5:45 to .. 7.</div><div><br /></div><div>Like in Jordan</div><div>Houses</div><div><br /></div><div>5/6 </div><div><br /></div><div>Breakfast.</div><div>Many tables adjoined, normal set-up never enough to accommodate family.</div><div>To left, Abu Ahmed, Osama and Abu Osama (good looking / younger wife on far right opposing), Nasser and baba across. Osama from way back, recognized at a distance after 33 years of separation. Nicknamed: father of candle (Abu sham3a) for nearly burning house down (woken luckily by cat and stopped fire). Kuwait a focus of conversation. Educational corruption, people buying degrees. Anecdotal evidence. How Kuwait has changed post war (double population). Still segmented and segregated among different araby countries (baba meeting few Kuwaitis in time there). </div><div>Conversations on the whole political, cultural, general. When verging into family matters, usually surface level, focused mainly on progression through phases of life. A brief rough in with deema, who commented that I look like I'm 'straight of Williamsburg. Asking about her brother, living in Boston (where?), and fsding to go shower, prepare for salat.</div><div>Series of turns and escalators to get masjid tucked away in mall. Typical mall masjid: low ceiling, light geometric adornments. Imam too close to mic (voice screeching). Khutba - the portion that passed through my brain - largely following prophets example, great dude. Trying to balance thoughts of day but mind wandering wandering..to? Lately ambitions are background noise. And portfolio, sort of imagining interaction, but also daunted at blank canvas I'll be starting with.</div><div><br /></div><div>A thought: feet clasped close to block devil's passage. And we pray. Rakat going by in a whirr. Leaving, dodging lasers like action movie.  Sunnah, everyone at their own pace.</div><div><br /></div><div>Room. Grumpy (should really take anti depressants or mood enhancers when home, extra push needed to both deal with fam and be optimistic. Former occupying brain now). Waiting waiting and then heading to pool.</div><div><br /></div><div>State of Arabic. Words flow, but concepts are reduced to proximal words. Works for the most part (peppering in English when needed), but state of communications is reduced to impersonal generalizations. Getting better at least..</div><div><br /></div><div>Pool. Omar, Yousuf, Nasser. Oogling disco ball adorned building and brainstorming potential Instagram caption (settling in: new wealth, old mentality. Or, effective way to flaunt wealth? Something dichotomous. Or simply: misplaced extravagance - spewing now and liking).</div><div><br /></div><div>Yousuf, meanwhile, making noises, playing with cylindrical pillows in room.</div><div><br /></div><div>Gym, hotel, and: wet sticky shorts, Pringles, tea, while waiting for Baba to emerge from restroom..</div><div><br /></div><div>(party)</div><div>setting up dessert booth w deema. flashy flashy.</div><div>doddling upon arrival.</div><div>statistical problem of permutations executed: every combo of people &amp; place necessitated a photo. and photo booth. loving it. why? why all these photos? why why?</div><div>not paying close attention to the many 'tragedies' that occurred (noticing food portions / table arrangements, but not yet blaming restaurant, thinking latter is maybe our fault?). fodder for conversation next three days.</div><div>good conversation about deema about what i'm doing and what i want to do (though little opportunity to ask her about her own work)</div><div>talking to ahmed's cousin, bright-eyed kuwaiti architect</div><div>feeling ~less confident. or maybe just quiet. suit not making me feel confident. feeling sort of..skinny, not very powerful. and like job, interests hold little social capital here. well that's not it, but maybe some of the causes? </div><div>noor's classmates, little talks here and there. </div><div>photobooth, back and forth. </div><div><br /></div><div>(engagement party recapping)</div><div>Moms side prettier than dads</div><div>Loop: disappointing moment </div><div>Restating with a slightly different anecdote (at the end they finally started moving)</div><div>Who had fun who didn't </div><div>Pick apart one person</div><div>Number of interactions can lead to many conversations </div><div>Samantha read message but didn't reply</div><div><br /></div><div>is journaling making it easier to access thoughts and emotions? am i turning into drake? can always take breaks from writing, or change style / add restrictions to prevent over-awareness..</div><div><br /></div><div>5/7 (doha -&gt; saudia)</div><div><br /></div><div>scrambling: up late, 10:30. 30 min until buffet close, surely missing out on seeing ahmed, noor &amp; other fam. so rushing, eating.</div><div>doddling: back from breakfast, shower, pack and -- wait. pick up objects here and there. 2pm, finally checked out.</div><div>goodbye: to seto, kiss and hug 2x, blessings 10x. khaled, moaz, amtu najat. standard, formal, 'visit again'. </div><div><br /></div><div>car: packaging math problems into card games</div><div><br /></div><div>baba and insects ~ what a weird unhealthy relationship. not too many in saudia..but asked nasser to get electric bug racket zapper.</div><div><br /></div><div>on the way - first 2 hours, simply engagement party complaints.</div><div>the 120 km beep (saudi-ism)</div><div>conversation roughly 2 hours w/ baba. top-down solutions to systemic problems. stemming from need for honestly, openness, in society that is incredibly incredibly corrupt. pitching ideas to me. first: testing service to certify experts in different fields/skills. experts are certified with same service. not bad, useful in: mad corrupt countries, large companies who want to outsource recruitment, or small companies scaling up and looking for someone with skill they don't know how to evaluate. had to narrow scope for baba though, didn't really address limitations on his own.</div><div>next one, can't remember exactly. last, school that pays teachers really well (okay okay cool whatever), but maintains quality of teachers with constant video surveillance? impractical for so many reasons. explaining to baba, over and over (stubbornly sticking to his position) until some sort of chord strikes, baba is excited by different idea, and conversation shifts..</div><div><br /></div><div>one thing i should tell you about my family - is that they specialize in unsolicited advice. </div><div><br /></div><div>home.</div><div>dining hall 4 dinn, laptop time (looking at typography, risd kid portfolios pre-bed)</div><div>then: lying on couch, listening to james blake colour in anything. thoughts forming still.</div><div><br /></div><div>5/8 - 5/9 (saudi):</div><div><br /></div><div>mornings: gym. killing time before lunch with nba 2k.</div><div>mood overall elevated, managing to be slightly more optimistic (ask mama/kids about day), and do activities with kids (frisbee + basketball with summer doof afterschool). cooking w mama (first day: black beans n tomato sauce, second: tacos), bringing home lunch (fatayer), doing groceries - somewhat useful. </div><div><br /></div><div>engagement complaints rekindled with Noor's letter. baba, noor, somehow shouting at each other? baba wanting full control of situation (do not send without passing through me first &lt;- categorizing personality, making sense of family patterns and frustrations). thought of: do intelligent people, on average, speak more or less about issue. always thought that there is more depth to issue, but now seeing how ineffective it is to stretch issue out, go on tangents.</div><div><br /></div><div>and thinking of the 3araby tradition of sitting, talking, having coffee to chill. no one ever seems phased that conversation might end or be awkward. and never really is? why is this? because there are endless family members to talk about? or, because each observation (Saudi is corrupt, for ex) is accompanied by many many stories. baba for sure hopping on many tangents. is this just the tradition or baba only. conversation as entertainment. (# social encounters perhaps also lessened, and group is often larger?).</div><div><br /></div><div>marriage on the mind on the mind. actually not so far-fetched to me. distant fear i won't find 3araby girl like me..</div><div><br /></div><div>look talk:</div><div>ahmed's underbite (how it bothered mama)</div><div>and then thinking to my jaw/face, mama's many comments about my long face lending to insecurity</div><div>and - looking through photos/videos of self in camping trip. not always looking bad i suppose. face is long but can look okay in some ways? but still, assessing, evaluating, taking many steps back in attempt to accept how i look.</div><div>can perhaps blame mama/3arab society for this particular insecurity</div><div><br /></div><div>living in brooklyn for the summer? committed, ready to delve in. whatsapping may. then then reassessing - like will it be harder to focus? will it actually be that interesting? contrasting to somerville life. waking up in nice comfy room. but then - then what. walk down same street, hang out with same non-existent people. most weekdays in house, alone. but also the potential to make friends that i can carry into next year? </div><div>but also - best time to leave. coming back to same life, not losing anything really. and chance to explore somewhere new, be young, keep alight the flame of making impulsive decisions.</div><div>(make decision, asap)</div><div><br /></div><div>thought of hashtag: #kidsbrains. photos/phrases summer, yousuf, or kids say.</div><div>(inspired by elizabeth goodspeed's #gooddiagrams)</div><div><br /></div><div>how much of family encounters have i blocked out of brain? could have written down things, analyzed, thought, actively changed behavior, understood where some of my weaknesses stem, and help family really..</div><div><br /></div><div>night:</div><div>noor, mama each separately talking to themselves. mama on phone, typing away at whatsapp groups. noor, doing some sort of errands and emails. me, 2k for a little. then, laptop back: craigslist hunt for sublets, working on mystery reader.</div><div><br /></div><div>5/11 - 5/12:</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>5/11 (wed):</div><div><br /></div><div>cinderella to mama's class. kids asking where i live what i do if i have a car. but mostly telling little details about themselves and family. jumping hopping. teacher diplomatic, asking kids to settle dispute themselves outside class (impressed).</div><div>is photobooth = vanity?</div><div><br /></div><div>(kids fascinating teaching fascinating great way to expand brain)</div><div><br /></div><div>frying fries, blasting music with summer, and talking about her progress with story.</div><div><br /></div><div>dinner (kofta) ready. well almost ready, salad + kofta complete, but rice just starting. baba to salat. like why? eat salad, wait 15 min. (what are we going to do? eat and just sit there? precisely). staying home in protest. (though caving at isha, after baba asking, 'not going to salat?')</div><div>engagement talk making resurgence, after phone call from kempinski. noor, for most of initial bit, in office, on laptop. telling noor to join, irritated 'just start without me' response. resolve in head to have functional healthy family that eats and discusses things of some substance at dinner party. </div><div><br /></div><div>reading rest of cairo's 'functional art'. interviews with journalists and freelancers. beginning portion: traditional infographic workers - nigel something eh, national geographic editor, meticulous graphics that take months and months, detail oriented. the slightly qualitative, less data density, more illustration-based types. and some humanitarian graphics (gapminder). nytimes/wash post. and last bit: three freelance visualizers. backgrounds as developers.

Frustration no longer unfiltered, coated in behavioral pattern observation.</div><div><br /></div><div>At once more distanced and connected to culture. Distance brings keen observation, interest.

Osama from way back, recognized at a distance after 33 years of separation. Nicknamed: father of candle (Abu sham3a) for nearly burning house down (woken luckily by cat and stopped fire). Kuwait a focus of conversation. Educational corruption, people buying degrees. Anecdotal evidence. How Kuwait has changed post war (double population). Still segmented and segregated among different araby countries (baba meeting few Kuwaitis in time there). </div><div>Conversations on the whole political, cultural, general. When verging into family matters, usually surface level, focused mainly on progression through phases of life. A brief rough in with deema, who commented that I look like I'm 'straight of Williamsburg. Asking about her brother, living in Boston (where?), and fsding to go shower, prepare for salat.</div><div>Series of turns and escalators to get masjid tucked away in mall. Typical mall masjid: low ceiling, light geometric adornments. Imam too close to mic (voice screeching). Khutba - the portion that passed through my brain - largely following prophets example, great dude. Trying to balance thoughts of day but mind wandering wandering..to? Lately ambitions are background noise. And portfolio, sort of imagining interaction, but also daunted at blank canvas I'll be starting with.</div><div><br /></div><div>A thought: feet clasped close to block devil's passage. And we pray. Rakat going by in a whirr. Leaving, dodging lasers like action movie.  Sunnah, everyone at their own pace.</div><div><br /></div><div>Room. Grumpy (should really take anti depressants or mood enhancers when home, extra push needed to both deal with fam and be optimistic. Former occupying brain now). Waiting waiting and then heading to pool.</div><div><br /></div><div>State of Arabic. Words flow, but concepts are reduced to proximal words. Works for the most part (peppering in English when needed), but state of communications is reduced to impersonal generalizations. Getting better at least..</div><div><br /></div><div>Pool.

why is this? because there are endless family members to talk about? or, because each observation (Saudi is corrupt, for ex) is accompanied by many many stories. baba for sure hopping on many tangents. is this just the tradition or baba only. conversation as entertainment.

Kuwaiti comedian lightening up mood. Story of carving own path that mother eventually came to respect. Rest, Arabic formalities. Even Quran reading. Graduations proceeding with quick hi five past sheikha moza. Grabbing a rings, not even shaking hand, and walking through small, makeshift mosaic gate.</div><div>Afterward, in vast convention center. Dim blue is lighting. Modern, sterile. Shiny red and black couches</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Constant comments from mama</div><div><br /></div><div>(Journaling standing in bathroom)</div><div><br /></div><div>
5/4 - Doha

	</div><div><br /></div><div>Brain in a not feeling it mood.</div><div>Tired, morning. Groggy stretches while waiting for Noor. Breakfast, lavish. Talking - well listening really - to conversation on my left: mama, Noor, Ahmed's mom. Graduation logistics, kids, daily matters. To right: Ahmed's dad. Cultural differences (America vs here, Americans have saying called 'what goes around comes around', greater sense of civic duty). Kuwait and Qatar similarity, issues with urban planning in gulf. Me, silent vacant, though, sharp, attentive.</div><div><br /></div><div>Taking yousuf to room, restless. Summer occupied by kindle, burning through books. Room. Sunny spacious. Forcing yousuf to read. difficulty channeling positive encouragement with reading, after repeated instances of lying (most blatant: on page 100 after like 20 minutes, with no idea of what happened in book).</div><div><br /></div><div>"</div><div><br /></div><div>5/5 </div><div><br /></div><div>Musings and observations about baba and family. Frustration no longer unfiltered, coated in behavioral pattern observation.</div><div><br /></div><div>At once more distanced and connected to culture. Distance brings keen observation, interest. Which can be aggregated, synthesized, processed emotionally - leading to connection, intimacy. Interesting (at least superficially 'a not paradoxical paradox type of thing)</div><div><br /></div><div>5pm dinner turning to 5:45 to .. 7.</div><div><br /></div><div>5/6 </div><div><br /></div><div>Breakfast.</div><div>Many tables adjoined, normal set-up never enough to accommodate family.</div><div>To left, Abu Ahmed, Osama and Abu Osama (good looking / younger wife on far right opposing), Nasser and baba across. Osama from way back, recognized at a distance after 33 years of separation. Nicknamed: father of candle (Abu sham3a) for nearly burning house down (woken luckily by cat and stopped fire). Kuwait a focus of conversation. Educational corruption, people buying degrees. Anecdotal evidence. How Kuwait has changed post war (double population). Still segmented and segregated among different araby countries (baba meeting few Kuwaitis in time there). </div><div>Conversations on the whole political, cultural, general. When verging into family matters, usually surface level, focused mainly on progression through phases of life. A brief rough in with deema, who commented that I look like I'm 'straight of Williamsburg. Asking about her brother, living in Boston (where?), and fsding to go shower, prepare for salat.</div><div>Series of turns and escalators to get masjid tucked away in mall. Typical mall masjid: low ceiling, light geometric adornments. Imam too close to mic (voice screeching). Khutba - the portion that passed through my brain - largely following prophets example, great dude. Trying to balance thoughts of day but mind wandering wandering..to? Lately ambitions are background noise. And portfolio, sort of imagining interaction, but also daunted at blank canvas I'll be starting with.</div><div><br /></div><div>A thought: feet clasped close to block devil's passage. And we pray. Rakat going by in a whirr. Leaving, dodging lasers like action movie.  Sunnah, everyone at their own pace.</div><div><br /></div><div>Room. Grumpy (should really take anti depressants or mood enhancers when home, extra push needed to both deal with fam and be optimistic. Former occupying brain now). Waiting waiting and then heading to pool.</div><div><br /></div><div>State of Arabic. Words flow, but concepts are reduced to proximal words. Works for the most part (peppering in English when needed), but state of communications is reduced to impersonal generalizations. Getting better at least..</div><div><br /></div><div>Pool. Omar, Yousuf, Nasser. Oogling disco ball adorned building and brainstorming potential Instagram caption (settling in: new wealth, old mentality. Or, effective way to flaunt wealth? Something dichotomous. Or simply: misplaced extravagance - spewing now and liking).</div><div><br /></div><div>Yousuf, meanwhile, making noises, playing with cylindrical pillows in room.</div><div><br /></div><div>Gym, hotel, and: wet sticky shorts, Pringles, tea, while waiting for Baba to emerge from restroom..</div><div><br /></div><div>(party)</div><div>setting up dessert booth w deema. flashy flashy.</div><div>doddling upon arrival.</div><div>statistical problem of permutations executed: every combo of people &amp; place necessitated a photo. and photo booth. loving it. why? why all these photos? why why?</div><div>not paying close attention to the many 'tragedies' that occurred (noticing food portions / table arrangements, but not yet blaming restaurant, thinking latter is maybe our fault?). fodder for conversation next three days.</div><div>good conversation about deema about what i'm doing and what i want to do (though little opportunity to ask her about her own work)</div><div>talking to ahmed's cousin, bright-eyed kuwaiti architect</div><div>feeling ~less confident. or maybe just quiet. suit not making me feel confident. feeling sort of..skinny, not very powerful. and like job, interests hold little social capital here. well that's not it, but maybe some of the causes? </div><div>noor's classmates, little talks here and there. </div><div>photobooth, back and forth. </div><div><br /></div><div>(engagement party recapping)</div><div>Moms side prettier than dads</div><div>Loop: disappointing moment </div><div>Restating with a slightly different anecdote (at the end they finally started moving)</div><div>Who had fun who didn't </div><div>Pick apart one person</div><div>Number of interactions can lead to many conversations </div><div>Samantha read message but didn't reply</div><div><br /></div><div>is journaling making it easier to access thoughts and emotions? am i turning into drake? can always take breaks from writing, or change style / add restrictions to prevent over-awareness..</div><div><br /></div><div>5/7 (doha -&gt; saudia)</div><div><br /></div><div>scrambling: up late, 10:30. 30 min until buffet close, surely missing out on seeing ahmed, noor &amp; other fam. so rushing, eating.</div><div>doddling: back from breakfast, shower, pack and -- wait. pick up objects here and there. 2pm, finally checked out.</div><div>goodbye: to seto, kiss and hug 2x, blessings 10x. khaled, moaz, amtu najat. standard, formal, 'visit again'. </div><div><br /></div><div>car: packaging math problems into card games</div><div><br /></div><div>baba and insects ~ what a weird unhealthy relationship. not too many in saudia..but asked nasser to get electric bug racket zapper.</div><div><br /></div><div>on the way - first 2 hours, simply engagement party complaints.</div><div>the 120 km beep (saudi-ism)</div><div>conversation roughly 2 hours w/ baba. top-down solutions to systemic problems. stemming from need for honestly, openness, in society that is incredibly incredibly corrupt. pitching ideas to me. first: testing service to certify experts in different fields/skills. experts are certified with same service. not bad, useful in: mad corrupt countries, large companies who want to outsource recruitment, or small companies scaling up and looking for someone with skill they don't know how to evaluate. had to narrow scope for baba though, didn't really address limitations on his own.</div><div>next one, can't remember exactly. last, school that pays teachers really well (okay okay cool whatever), but maintains quality of teachers with constant video surveillance? impractical for so many reasons. explaining to baba, over and over (stubbornly sticking to his position) until some sort of chord strikes, baba is excited by different idea, and conversation shifts..</div><div><br /></div><div>one thing i should tell you about my family - is that they specialize in unsolicited advice. </div><div><br /></div><div>home.</div><div>dining hall 4 dinn, laptop time (looking at typography, risd kid portfolios pre-bed)</div><div>then: lying on couch, listening to james blake colour in anything. thoughts forming still.</div><div><br /></div><div>5/8 - 5/9 (saudi):</div><div><br /></div><div>mornings: gym. killing time before lunch with nba 2k.</div><div>mood overall elevated, managing to be slightly more optimistic (ask mama/kids about day), and do activities with kids (frisbee + basketball with summer doof afterschool). cooking w mama (first day: black beans n tomato sauce, second: tacos), bringing home lunch (fatayer), doing groceries - somewhat useful. </div><div><br /></div><div>engagement complaints rekindled with Noor's letter. baba, noor, somehow shouting at each other? baba wanting full control of situation (do not send without passing through me first &lt;- categorizing personality, making sense of family patterns and frustrations). thought of: do intelligent people, on average, speak more or less about issue. always thought that there is more depth to issue, but now seeing how ineffective it is to stretch issue out, go on tangents.</div><div><br /></div><div>and thinking of the 3araby tradition of sitting, talking, having coffee to chill. no one ever seems phased that conversation might end or be awkward. and never really is? why is this? because there are endless family members to talk about? or, because each observation (Saudi is corrupt, for ex) is accompanied by many many stories. baba for sure hopping on many tangents. is this just the tradition or baba only. conversation as entertainment. (# social encounters perhaps also lessened, and group is often larger?).</div><div><br /></div><div>marriage on the mind on the mind. actually not so far-fetched to me. distant fear i won't find 3araby girl like me..</div><div><br /></div><div>look talk:</div><div>ahmed's underbite (how it bothered mama)</div><div>and then thinking to my jaw/face, mama's many comments about my long face lending to insecurity</div><div>and - looking through photos/videos of self in camping trip. not always looking bad i suppose. face is long but can look okay in some ways? but still, assessing, evaluating, taking many steps back in attempt to accept how i look.</div><div>can perhaps blame mama/3arab society for this particular insecurity</div><div><br /></div><div>living in brooklyn for the summer? committed, ready to delve in. whatsapping may. then then reassessing - like will it be harder to focus? will it actually be that interesting? contrasting to somerville life. waking up in nice comfy room. but then - then what. walk down same street, hang out with same non-existent people. most weekdays in house, alone. but also the potential to make friends that i can carry into next year? </div><div>but also - best time to leave. coming back to same life, not losing anything really. and chance to explore somewhere new, be young, keep alight the flame of making impulsive decisions.</div><div>(make decision, asap)</div><div><br /></div><div>thought of hashtag: #kidsbrains. photos/phrases summer, yousuf, or kids say.</div><div>(inspired by elizabeth goodspeed's #gooddiagrams)</div><div><br /></div><div>how much of family encounters have i blocked out of brain? could have written down things, analyzed, thought, actively changed behavior, understood where some of my weaknesses stem, and help family really..</div><div><br /></div><div>night:</div><div>noor, mama each separately talking to themselves. mama on phone, typing away at whatsapp groups. noor, doing some sort of errands and emails. me, 2k for a little. then, laptop back: craigslist hunt for sublets, working on mystery reader.</div><div><br /></div><div>5/11 - 5/12:</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>5/11 (wed):</div><div><br /></div><div>cinderella to mama's class. kids asking where i live what i do if i have a car. but mostly telling little details about themselves and family. jumping hopping. teacher diplomatic, asking kids to settle dispute themselves outside class (impressed).</div><div>is photobooth = vanity?</div><div><br /></div><div>(kids fascinating teaching fascinating great way to expand brain)</div><div><br /></div><div>frying fries, blasting music with summer, and talking about her progress with story.</div><div><br /></div><div>dinner (kofta) ready. well almost ready, salad + kofta complete, but rice just starting. baba to salat. like why? eat salad, wait 15 min. (what are we going to do? eat and just sit there? precisely). staying home in protest. (though caving at isha, after baba asking, 'not going to salat?')</div><div>engagement talk making resurgence, after phone call from kempinski. noor, for most of initial bit, in office, on laptop. telling noor to join, irritated 'just start without me' response. resolve in head to have functional healthy family that eats and discusses things of some substance at dinner party. </div><div><br /></div><div>reading rest of cairo's 'functional art'. interviews with journalists and freelancers. beginning portion: traditional infographic workers - nigel something eh, national geographic editor, meticulous graphics that take months and months, detail oriented. the slightly qualitative, less data density, more illustration-based types. and some humanitarian graphics (gapminder). nytimes/wash post. and last bit: three freelance visualizers. backgrounds as developers.

Narrow understanding of depression on Baba's side. why can't he just go out? clearly he needs to go out. needs to do things to himself up. frustrated w little tolerance - treading more lightly than usual, but not at all understanding irrationality danny is experiencing. And baba's career regrets of not specializing, talking about his friend Omar. </div><div><br /></div><div>looping conversations: baba managing to at least present in slightly different ways, extrapolate slightly tangential lessons from his experiences. making do with what he has. but what he has is..not very much rich experience. or, unfair, has had a fulfilling and difficult life, but has not had the intellectual and creative channels to constantly imbue new experiences, and stories into life. </div><div>why loop why loop?</div><div><br /></div><div>can you build an artist colony in Saudia?</div><div>and attachment to home, middle east:</div><div><br /></div><div>Ahmed @dammam airport. words flowing for two-ish hours chilling. Path in work - how I found something I'm into, engagement (drama), trip here so far, Riyadh like?

Read surah before and after meeting. Syrians and looking and comparing to others. different design frustrations. Gate numbers. Extending to windy conversation. Font size. Starting with Danny and advertising and emphasizing certain words with fonts. Then gate size. Showing where it should be displayed how big. And then passing gate: 'look look it's not here look look'. Loud displaced anger. Me, quiet. Like chill, signs here suck. Then, other signs: no building number! But map uses building for reference.</div><div>tangent:  have you heard of projection? psychological projection. baba and how he might project importance of something by yelling or getting angry/frustrated at value clash (like bad manners). erm you got lots of projection. surprised by how this is novel. how inward look, self-awareness, somewhat novel. thinking of how baba was taught no emotional intelligence, raised in Kuwaiti slums. and maybe this lends to lacking emotional intelligence.</div><div><br /></div><div>thinking of genetics and (terrifying) potential similarities between me and baba, mama. small, sort of meaningless things like how baba stresses 's' in salam alaikum. how he wants everything ready, in place before leaving. </div><div>(noticing - and not drawing comparisons - of extreme impatience. like knocking on bathroom when, fan on, i'm clearly pooping, getting me to get up, turn off fan, and answer question of 'how long i will be' to gauge whether he should go upstairs? just go upstairs bro)</div><div><br /></div><div>wanting to observe culture and family a bit more. starting to classify family behavior, categorize country &amp; saudis. but sort of ready to leave.</div><div><br /></div><div>lunch w amu danny + fams. large portions of conversation, danny staring out into space (mentioning story of ahmed, getting into it, trying to get danny involved, but completely zoned out, until baba tries to get attention with 'have you heard of mckinsey?' really?..). discomfort. some okay but trite bits about conversation - like how germany is amazing. and noor's educational interest. usual stories of corruption or other depressing things. but then baba sort of filling air with words. how he urges me to specialize in one thing (regretting this in his career - not the time to talk about career regrets baba..). baba talking about his failed business venture, reciting stories i, and, mostly likely, danny has heard too - good reception to some sort of gas station management app, all the right pieces in place,  co-founder however bailed and start-up went bankrupt. but also talking about business (working for self, how that's amazing). danny staring in space, me, half-heartedly listening, but words are dragging, badgering. slightly less awkward points of conversation: boston, coursework, post-grad life vanishing quickly (oh good that's good). diverting attention to yousuf (read ayat kursi..) to avoid conversation - that really is bound to go nowhere. or at least feels that way. </div><div>odd goodbye, shaking hand, saying 'glad to see path you're going on, proud to know you'. and then standing there, static. a whirr. a saudi whirr.</div><div><br /></div><div>the dark dusty undertones of interactions in saudia. </div><div>(feeling bad for baba. so much heart, effort. in work, frienships. but little return.)</div><div><br /></div><div>small frustrations: going to buy water bottles near gas station. maybe 3-5 min wait. why did that take so long? (line). or, mama to me, defensively: well, you can't even take negativity, you shut people down. true, shutting down loops of negativity. loops. tired of conversational loops.</div><div>sort of defying idea siavash and i talking about: how, with conversation, you have to be more intelligence and intentional, can't repeat useless thought patterns that occur in head. but family = stark contrast to this idea.</div><div><br /></div><div>6pm, home, feeling urge to - do the mindless phone checks, play 2k, eat random food. mostly brushing away. james blake &amp; writing. first listening, then reading, interview. jamesy lifting frustration.</div><div>getting summer to finish comic (wanting to do stickmen, not cool w me), and yousuf to read book.</div><div><br /></div><div>reading of how james blake opened up writing/producing, brought in others. but how do you get feedback on abstract lyrics? do you convey state of mind, roughly draw analogies to feelings and thoughts? and then show lyrics, as for feedback? or maybe pushes in direction / rough tweaks. hm..</div><div><br /></div><div>thinking of: how to explain this break to others.</div><div>and journey back. music, podcasts, reading - revisiting journal!!</div><div><br /></div><div>workign then chilling - truly chilling - talking, hanging, with summer &amp; doof.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>5/14 - 5/15:</div><div><br /></div><div>5/14 (saturday):</div><div><br /></div><div>up and kids up, having finished projects (yousuf book, summer comic), unveiling rayman. </div><div>then - lunch party @tandoori:</div><div>quarrel right before leaving. wait for mama's coffee to boil? no, we're late. baba: you've been up all morning: why didn't you start this earlier? argument continuing into car (venting to just me) about mama's poor planning, negativity, etc. absorbing.</div><div>at tandoori, guests relatively early. quick/easy set-up and then</div><div>the salams. the alhamdullilah, work is good. i graduated engineering, working in data. alhamdullilah. master's inshallah. wife inshallah. </div><div>relatively interesting conversations with: nasser, katie's husband, healthcare data, neuroengineering, and yousuf's dad, neighbor. life in rak'a compound, aramco's decisions &amp; investments. abdullah najjar - diversion from engineering to law school (:o) and brother: should i go to grad school?</div><div>yazan's dad: pick a good wife. me: thxman. (and and how do i do this without dating?)</div><div><br /></div><div>this feeling of seeing person or object in hyper-realistic, almost distant lens.

<en-note><div>5/12</div><div><br/></div><div>meeting w ahmed. first: salat (baba piling on sunnahs), then shawarma pick-up (mishwar).</div><div>en route to airport, talking about:&nbsp;Danny&apos;s deep depression. Trapped in Saudi, no job, leaving high paying job at previous company. Narrow understanding of depression on Baba&apos;s side. why can&apos;t he just go out? clearly he needs to go out. needs to do things to himself up. frustrated w little tolerance - treading more lightly than usual, but not at all understanding irrationality danny is experiencing. And baba&apos;s career regrets of not specializing, talking about his friend Omar.&nbsp;</div><div><br/></div><div>looping conversations: baba managing to at least present in slightly different ways, extrapolate slightly tangential lessons from his experiences. making do with what he has. but what he has is..not very much rich experience. or, unfair, has had a fulfilling and difficult life, but has not had the intellectual and creative channels to constantly imbue new experiences, and stories into life.&nbsp;</div><div>why loop why loop?</div><div><br/></div><div>can you build an artist colony in Saudia?</div><div>and attachment to home, middle east:</div><div><br/></div><div>Ahmed @dammam airport. words flowing for two-ish hours chilling.&nbsp;Path in work - how I found something I&apos;m into,&nbsp;engagement (drama), trip here so far,&nbsp;Riyadh like? (No girls no girls). In phosphate mine in al Khair.</div><div>Dubai like? Girls? Nowhere (profitable) to return to in the Middle East - apart from Gulf. like vibes good, laughter, easy conversation (fidgety though, and sometimes like giving too much intense eye contact and deliberately trying not to give eye contact but eyes not drifting naturally, movement away from eye contact is too force and everything is forced.</div><div>home @ 11, house littered with party favors, food, dessert (scooping: chai, tiramasu). mindless 2k mash, sleep.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>5/13</div><div><br/></div><div>(fitness) morning &amp; gym (volume training) feeling bigger though like not sure how body is handled increased food intake (appetite up tho)</div><div><br/></div><div>&apos;I wish you would be 1/10th as nice to summer as yousuf&apos;. Spark.</div><div><br/></div><div>jum&apos;a. few recordings here and there for mixing. khutba, as usual, mush of arabic, seriousness, formality.&nbsp;mind wandering of course. to: portfolio, lists-based writing (&apos;adulthood = &apos; being okay with waiting in line, not understanding something weird or seemingly irrational kids want, something about phases of life &amp; marriage). to: architecture of mosque, not as grand as i had pictured, save for mosaic tiles. imam, swagger walking in, going through everybody.</div><div>post: salams salams and blessings. Seems genuine sort of but like what does this socialization amount to?</div><div>Social meaning..</div><div><br/></div><div>car ride back from jum&apos;a. hasad. Seriously? Read surah before and after meeting. Syrians and looking and comparing to others. different design frustrations. Gate numbers. Extending to windy conversation. Font size. Starting with Danny and advertising and emphasizing certain words with fonts. Then gate size. Showing where it should be displayed how big. And then passing gate: &apos;look look it&apos;s not here look look&apos;. Loud displaced anger. Me, quiet. Like chill, signs here suck. Then, other signs: no building number! But map uses building for reference.</div><div>tangent: &nbsp;have you heard of projection? psychological projection. baba and how he might project importance of something by yelling or getting angry/frustrated at value clash (like bad manners). erm you got lots of projection. surprised by how this is novel. how inward look, self-awareness, somewhat novel. thinking of how baba was taught no emotional intelligence, raised in Kuwaiti slums. and maybe this lends to lacking emotional intelligence.</div><div><br/></div><div>thinking of genetics and (terrifying) potential similarities between me and baba, mama. small, sort of meaningless things like how baba stresses &apos;s&apos; in salam alaikum. how he wants everything ready, in place before leaving.&nbsp;</div><div>(noticing - and not drawing comparisons - of extreme impatience. like knocking on bathroom when, fan on, i&apos;m clearly pooping, getting me to get up, turn off fan, and answer question of &apos;how long i will be&apos; to gauge whether he should go upstairs? just go upstairs bro)</div><div><br/></div><div>wanting to observe culture and family a bit more. starting to classify family behavior, categorize country &amp; saudis. but sort of ready to leave.</div><div><br/></div><div>lunch w amu danny + fams. large portions of conversation, danny staring out into space (mentioning story of ahmed, getting into it, trying to get danny involved, but completely zoned out, until baba tries to get attention with &apos;have you heard of mckinsey?&apos; really?..). discomfort. some okay but trite bits about conversation - like how germany is amazing. and noor&apos;s educational interest. usual stories of corruption or other depressing things. but then baba sort of filling air with words. how he urges me to specialize in one thing (regretting this in his career - not the time to talk about career regrets baba..). baba talking about his failed business venture, reciting stories i, and, mostly likely, danny has heard too - good reception to some sort of gas station management app, all the right pieces in place,&nbsp; co-founder however bailed and start-up went bankrupt. but also talking about business (working for self, how that&apos;s amazing). danny staring in space, me, half-heartedly listening, but words are dragging, badgering. slightly less awkward points of conversation: boston, coursework, post-grad life vanishing quickly (oh good that&apos;s good). diverting attention to yousuf (read ayat kursi..) to avoid conversation - that really is bound to go nowhere. or at least feels that way.&nbsp;</div><div>odd goodbye, shaking hand, saying &apos;glad to see path you&apos;re going on, proud to know you&apos;. and then standing there, static. a whirr. a saudi whirr.</div><div><br/></div><div>the dark dusty undertones of interactions in saudia.&nbsp;</div><div>(feeling bad for baba. so much heart, effort. in work, frienships. but little return.)</div><div><br/></div><div>small frustrations: going to buy water bottles near gas station. maybe 3-5 min wait. why did that take so long? (line). or, mama to me, defensively: well, you can&apos;t even take negativity, you shut people down. true, shutting down loops of negativity. loops. tired of conversational loops.</div><div>sort of defying idea siavash and i talking about: how, with conversation, you have to be more intelligence and intentional, can&apos;t repeat useless thought patterns that occur in head. but family = stark contrast to this idea.</div><div><br/></div><div>6pm, home, feeling urge to - do the mindless phone checks, play 2k, eat random food. mostly brushing away. james blake &amp; writing. first listening, then reading, interview. jamesy lifting frustration.</div><div>getting summer to finish comic (wanting to do stickmen, not cool w me), and yousuf to read book.</div><div><br/></div><div>reading of how james blake opened up writing/producing, brought in others. but how do you get feedback on abstract lyrics? do you convey state of mind, roughly draw analogies to feelings and thoughts? and then show lyrics, as for feedback? or maybe pushes in direction / rough tweaks. hm..</div><div><br/></div><div>thinking of: how to explain this break to others.</div><div>and journey back. music, podcasts, reading - revisiting journal!!</div><div><br/></div><div>workign then chilling - truly chilling - talking, hanging, with summer &amp; doof.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>5/14 - 5/15:</div><div><br/></div><div>5/14 (saturday):</div><div><br/></div><div>up and kids up, having finished projects (yousuf book, summer comic), unveiling rayman.&nbsp;</div><div>then - lunch party @tandoori:</div><div>quarrel right before leaving. wait for mama&apos;s coffee to boil? no, we&apos;re late. baba: you&apos;ve been up all morning: why didn&apos;t you start this earlier? argument continuing into car (venting to just me) about mama&apos;s poor planning, negativity, etc. absorbing.</div><div>at tandoori, guests relatively early. quick/easy set-up and then</div><div>the salams. the alhamdullilah, work is good. i graduated engineering, working in data. alhamdullilah. master&apos;s inshallah. wife inshallah.&nbsp;</div><div>relatively interesting conversations with: nasser, katie&apos;s husband, healthcare data, neuroengineering, and yousuf&apos;s dad, neighbor. life in rak&apos;a compound, aramco&apos;s decisions &amp; investments. abdullah najjar - diversion from engineering to law school (:o) and brother: should i go to grad school?</div><div>yazan&apos;s dad: pick a good wife. thxman. (and and how do i do this without dating?)</div><div><br/></div><div>this feeling of seeing person or object in hyper-realistic, almost distant lens. (acid-like) first time, at mishwar, before dammam airport. looking at baba and thinking, feeling: this is the first time i look at you, truly look at you, so deeply. and tandoori:&nbsp;amu fathi lingering. staring at him, looking strange. not like weird or deformed or scary, just truly studying him, taking him in, and realizing that his physical body stood purely as a symbol for &apos;amu fathi&apos; - but never focused on his physical form..</div><div><br/></div><div>--the vacant salams and alhamdullilah&apos;s (though ostensibly genuine): .. this whole method of socializing.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>afternoon&nbsp;= packing</div><div>family doddling for an hour - discussing what to do. me, pack, mama &amp; noor dining hall (summer at first joining, returning over paranoia that yousuf &amp; friends will choose her rayman character and fuck thangs up). worries dispelled by physical pain - summer closing door on finger as she walks in.</div><div>yousuf &amp; yousuf &amp; mariam, hanging xboxing</div><div>mama &amp; noor pack. munching, and talking about amu fathi&apos;s (absurd) frugality. driving one daughter nearly anorexic, and both incapable of socializing and carrying themselves in public context. getting through college in absurdly short tmie..</div><div><br/></div><div>night time. noor and i side by side. me, browsing shoes (hypebeast, kith type sneakers), her apartments, talking to self. company, i suppose, but retrospectively - why didn&apos;t i look at apartments with her? or start conversation, or something. the big questions like: why ahmed? lingering still.

<en-note>
<div>5/16 - 5/17:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5/16:</div>
<div>boston ~9:30am.</div>
<div>cab driver, ethiopian muslim. how he wants son to move to dubai after graduation. sins and temptations of american world. can’t escape.</div>
<div>getting home. a poofy siavash awaiting. </div>
<div>unpacking, groceries, cleaning.</div>
<div>tiny bit of html/css tutorials.</div>
<div>night-time. just a couple of puffs. and music. listening to recordings from doha/break. mainly white noise. but then recording voice, altering (gotta feel alive mothafucka never die), and beatboxing (interesting..). sharing with siavash, who saw some interesting ideas.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5/17:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>analyzing productivity/brain blocks:</div>
<div>feeling like creative blocks, or low willpower, is largely negative feedback loop. emotional well-being is related, but often productivity is shaped by - a state of mind - that i don’t seem to be entirely in control of. and that thinking about this state of mind, documenting the negativity, will only make it more real, perpetuate it. </div>
<div>but then, i don’t develop of confronting creative/willpower blocks.</div>
<div>so, resolving to start looking into brain.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today. work confined to code school tutorials. first html/css (culmination = low-fi, highlighted resume, digging aesthetic), then javascript. a bit slow / hard to focus for long periods. but working through, breaks for conversation, walk (to deposit money).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>visualizing impending summer..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking of the next meal</div>
<div>snacking on things while cooking</div>
<div>(activate the racing thoughts)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>meditation</div>
<div>(siavash: health week, adam and i: skepta, kamaiyah)</div>
<div>siavash’s new plans - music, sewing, d3</div>
<div>seeing siavash’s overall productivity..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the feeling, at night of, what now. wanting day to end but also need to be revitalized, have dreams brew in positive weird spaces.</div>
<div>feeling of - things to do - like ordering, but not movilizing</div>
<div>mobilizing..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>need to have more intermittent journaling</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>greenery and air and ahh</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(no more brooklyn)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Stymied last night</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5:18</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Today - trying to cultivate a 'access the brain' whenever mentality. Like write even when not feeling like it. Partly to write about process and progress.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The mental block of - why am I doing JavaScript tutorials/feeling like beginner/delving into new world so late. And same justification to self as to why I'm doing this course</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Sharper visual acuity?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Skepta joining James Blake and chance as </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Beautiful self-dictated routine. Like freelancing must await in the future.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Podcast, female genital mutilation in small Islamic sect. Phenomenal of group values changing (conflicting with personal) after already subscribing to group. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The breaks.</div>
<div>-the deviant crowd- adults at coffee shop during work hours. What's their story?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Maturity through lens of chance and James Blake </div>
<div>Style thoughts </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Siavash hypochondriac</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mechanism by which first impulse becomes facet of personality /'a like or dislike </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Coursework: jQuery all day really. Basic selection and animation. Angular intro next.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Weed?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5/19</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Finishing tutorial quickly in morning</div>
<div>Indecision w flight</div>
<div>Distraction touching</div>
<div>Working a bit the nine bar</div>
<div>Rx all day</div>
<div>Body stuff</div>
<div>Huaraches okay</div>
<div>Meral long chat </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5/20</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Thoughts </div>
<div>Surfacing</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A digital dude.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Background noise mostly ambitions lately. This abstract creative life (in ny) meeting likeminded Arab girl and dressed fresh fly to death.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Work starting 7am + sunlight till 8 + breaks, new rooms poses postures, making 12 hour workday fly by.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Actionalizing bsckground noise. Ambitions = great for changing direction. But now, sitting in this direction, should somehow cater background noise to be smaller, more nitty gritty. So I don't feel weird about being novice, doing tutorials, not contributing to society. Instead accepting, focused.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Work. Morning occupied with rx data. Sort of going in circles proving and dispelling conclusions. Method of data analysis is messy, files, tabs accumulating and growing into an independent entity.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>But done, relatively. May enhance analysis w risk scores (would get to heart of matter). Disappointed with amount of work / relatively lame end product. A static line plot in a blog post that I didn't write?</div>
<div>Digging in through risk scores like what do I know about this product really or healthcare at large.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Some things don't change: dog bark prompting jolt, disorientation.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Off to gym. Digging up old nikes (better for feet). Warm. Jogging to warm up - and end up jogging for 40 min. Exercises written on hand, plan, organically dissolving. A beautiful manifestation of desire reigning over arbitrary barriers.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Not wanting to journal = anti social w self. True antisocial quality, bereft of awkwardness or capability of socializing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Me: I know I like freedom - career of freelancing awaiting?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Looking at work emails like 'that sounds boring'. Not realizing how confined/bound to Arcadia I felt, bending and manipulating role to slightest semblance of what I want. Now, feeling like </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A feeling of - being human..?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Biking around. A couple loops, unintentionally. On first pass, kids playing</div>
<div>Second unintentional loop sunnier, beckoning me. Bike on the floor, joining company of fit cute girl (30ft away).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Work on sense of direction, look at maps + wander + guess wandering trajectory.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Today mind feeling good n grounded but in the back of head this image of smoking dope and looking extra fly, feeling super chill. U know.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Battering conversation at Adam</div>
<div>Convo w yuki </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>'Come on vincent'. A factual cheer. Lone dad/parent at practice. (Image image)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>What do I have to do do I have to do</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Basketball court lucidity faded good vibes</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Quit talkin numbers </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A strong desire to make music</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Perfectionism vs not in quality - like young thug</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>How is life not so interesting all the time vs my life will never interesting </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Some bad jokes and Siavash stares</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Kanye thug and skepta dropping me to train station </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>No longer spontaneously running </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The debate to uber or train and what it means</div>
<div>Drinking / socializing. A hyper realistic train station, exchanges of 'swag'while leaving train station. Why do I wear a hat. I mean it's not comfortable, solely because it's cool - what does that say about me</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The night a blur and a whirr and all these girls not many supercool but some need to make effort and take number </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Drunkenness. A couple hoodnyea </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A sudden flip in decision to go to New York. Caseys few sentences completely changing mind. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>With Allie: space away from work w good way of understanding desires and ambitions </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Telling Casey about being home and grounded in responsibilities</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>With Margo: how there is so much / so little to talk about to a stranger </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Caught observing at a club/bar. Wasn't awkward until.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A sudden shift and resolve to live in New York for the summer. = I should text ol Carlos? Indecision such a deeply ingrained flaw in me. What does it mean - in terms of modes of thinking?</div>
<div>Scary implications for marriage.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Morning 5/21</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Groggy and slight head buzz (they call this hangover I suppose). Sitting in toilet, sipping water, flipping through phone. Message from summer, littered with emojis asking if made it back. Then calling me 'chicken' , 'potato'. Brilliant wake up.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Outside and - talking to may about moving perils.</div>
<div>Stranger walking by, taking photo (the way I held book in light ?). At the powder house feeling summery and youthful.</div>
<div>But work still lingering.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>long day. nice way.</div>
<div>morning self-time. then - home. gym, shower. grouping with siavash, and adam for coffee. in the square. things talking about things most distinctly remembering siavash’s past night, too much boiled weed resulting in slow and meaningless social interactions. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>working on music (the track with shabazz) then</div>
<div>adam and i talking about approaches to relationships - how adam’s genuine communication of feelings created misunderstanding, deeming himself asshole. me, countering, saying no - this is how you act, naturally. i mean you don’t process your feelings for her in terms of a relationship, just in terms of her - as a person. i mean yes you try to be mindful of traditional approaches to relationships still, but multiple ways to process / communicate</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the self. and personality. recurring thoughts really all day.</div>
<div>and judging. am i becoming more judgmental as an adult? thinking in the context of socialization and how i can more quickly cast out people who i don’t feel like i will click with. perhaps college filtered some of those people, and was equally judgmental? though thinking probably not..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>how do you talk to people?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thoughts of deep-rooted indecisiveness, of course. (thinking: mine journal for stuff like: decisiveness - chronicling RECURRING ISSUES)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>adam and i, exploring relationship conversation deeply, then gently casting it aside, and lighting small joint. couple puffs outside, passerby’s abound. porchfest. making it socially acceptable to walk around w/ speaker, on head? yes. balancing perfectly in walk all the way to davis, little dragon greeting/scaring/confusing general population</div>
<div>up highland ave, turn to: the theremin house. man, intensely focused. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>angela’s. ben there, and sister. hi to both. ben, new job as human factors engineer. guess who, stereotypical. banter with angela and co. fun as usual. establishing a ‘just pop by’ type of relationship with angela. a good step i think. a small undercurrent of stress from - decision to go out with emad (in town, rare) or stay in. deciding: shisha cafe as break..</div>
<div>shisha w/ emad, anas, and cute brazilian palestinian muslim girl? emad: graduated. desire to work for government. or even as a lobbyist (lobby world truly as grimy as it sounds). crazy abusive relationship with yara, done. me described in life path and ambitions. a little this and that, and tea, served nicely with miramiah, but a too much sugar.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>how incredibly intelligent siavash is. intelligence stemming from his structured thought, ability to break down abstract pieces of work into clear thought process. and, in more bottom-up approach, trying to develop music from emotions, turning this abstract thing into structure. </div>
<div>resolve this discussion: listen to more ‘song exploder’ podcasts. like understand different processes and approaches. </div>
<div>(was kind of liking but now questioning: my purely intuitive approach to making music. data person in me says: that’s inefficient, not going to get me places)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home and - delving into music conversations. a nice, comfortable welcome. starting with - video describing rap structures, how mf doom defies all.</div>
<div>then: music process. conveying emotions. transcending structures and genre. example</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>is it bad that i’m such an intuition-driven person?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>maybe make interactive writing like more real-time</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>chronicling RECURRING ISSUES)chronicling RECURRING ISSUES)chronicling RECURRING ISSUES) frame in context of - mental health</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5/22</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Jade's birthday today making me think of conversations - imaginary - that I have with jade (or other vacant imaginary friends that maybe also function as therapists)? Sort of explaining the growth / learning over this past year. Starting with explanation of jelly self to confronting self to mental health? And then actual day to day things.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>data as this beautiful way of giving meaning to my weird fluid self. because, you can start to derive meaning from small, genuine pieces of information. rather than working within an assertion and backing one. (making think of academic papers and how this is opposite).</div>
<div>i think that: data gives meaning to my world (of subconscious explorations). sort of fits in with my view of the world of why i hate quotes. or self-help books. or advice. seeing aggregate of data without seeing complexity is not meaningful. but being able to word with data, to create the aggregate is beautiful? making funny face at this last sentence because losing coherence in this train of thought..</div>
<div>re-try:</div>
<div>
<div>really, i’m trying to seek truth.</div>
<div>my interest in data - overlapping with my overall view of the world. </div>
<div>making sense of small (sub-conscious) pieces of information. what machines are spewing is small, 'sub-conscious’, ‘crude’ de-narrativized information. in both cases, i believe this is a close representation of seeking truth.</div>
</div>
<div>(then go into talking about skill set).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday - thoughts of demeaning my ability to come up with ideas but this is meaningless because ideas usually come from a relatively structured place or state of mind and i have that and i come up with ideas and like just kill these  unproductive thoughts, have some confidence. okay? </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>‘++/expand’ notebook. thought patterns of: data/personality/journal starting to develop into a potential project?</div>
<div>idea: displaying indecisive process in finding this apartment, side by side with journal entries of my feelings. getting to - what i really valued here. and assessing overall (negative) impact of my doodling and decision-making delay maybe mapping an alternate reality. show dates side by side too.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A podcast about entanglement. Atomic first, then mirror synesthesia, and a finally, a normal sort of empathetic entanglement with others. Feeding into ongoing (internal) discussion of personality and self. Also: home; and how negativity and laziness fed into own mental state - a natural phenomenon. Mental resilience really is needed..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Too much noise in my head to really listen to music. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>While writing brain drifting to - bank account, kid next to me, the next paragraph, the other paragraph I forgot to fill. My fluid view on life and self and how much that will hinder me. My inability to stick to a plan. But this is right all right because it feels right and because I'm a feeling person ..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Prescription analysis integrating with risk and - beautiful, linear correlation. Framing project (with other data) as risk and data segmentation. (Can I publish this?)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>More and more like: why am I going to Arcadia? Also questioning data science visualization focus. But I question any decision I make, right? I do, I do. Strength / weakness (thinking of: displaying weaknesses on portfolio. How they're maybe more indicative of person?). Working backwards - making an assertion and then thinking, 'why does that work'?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Fixing my brain's decision-making capabilities.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mobilizing decision to move back to ny. First, a June sublet.</div>
<div>How brain </div>
<div>Actually breaking down how brain is flawed, right now</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Today. Review all the code tutorials. Order clothing I wanted.</div>
<div>Downloading and setting up bumble.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>prompted to think of like - what really physically concretely makes me likes this music. i suppose it is emotions? </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5/23 - 5/24:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>writing from a four tet boiler room environment.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5/23 (yesterday):</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>idea - look at retrospective vs current journal entries. how content varies in richness? i suppose that’s expected. or reductiveness. the process of narrativization. eh.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hm. gym, some gym. cambridge public library, some d3. add two lines, remove one on click. re-factor, make more ‘d3’. understand how line function works. taking: too long. figuring out coursework. frustrating unresponsiveness from bloc. not starting today? not starting today. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>looking at restroom inscription in library: use whichever restroom you’re comfortable with - or the gender-neutral on first floor.. fresh from home trip: hitting me how beautifully progressive cambridge is.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>carrying the stress of: new york sublet? talking to siavash about this, a quip like: just draw it out. throwing remark out while retreating to computer. taking social cue, going to room. maybe spiking some sort of awareness in me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a negative energy throughout day. starting course when? brooklyn? indecisiveness wearing down wearing down. </div>
<div>(a swiping break. mostly no matches w bumble except girl like ‘hey you seem nerdy and cute')</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>decently productive music-making at night. finally progressing in shabazz palace remake song.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5/24:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>too much self-awareness today i think.</div>
<div>but not enough awareness.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sometimes the feeling of being confined. like mentally. and knowing i need to write or listen to music or walk but like - want to stay confined. need to completely eradicate. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sorting out bloc course: next monday.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>just like whip out diary whip it out when needed. need to do more real-time. helps prevent ridiculous thought loops.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>spent: like 45 min of day trying on shoes. another 45 (?) thinking about size discrepancies. then, sized up, committed to new pair, and: size still not right?</div>
<div>mentally a bit shaky. blocking thoughts, skeptical of what i can accomplish in these 3 months, as person, and in day-day focus. fuckdat. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>conversation with colin. breakup with michael (similarities to me w/ stef: finally getting more happy, social, and no longer feeling for other). getting closer to lab people. socializing with general sports/science-literate masses. (can be stirred to think other things). home. the negative aspects only really. new job situation.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>an awkward conversation with lena’s roommate robin (brooklyn sublet). me awkward, robin not. tell me about you. so: i grew up here and do this, like this is what i’m doing now. a happy upbeat energy that i don’t quite know how to place. one beat off. around 15 min mark. exchanging the essentials and logistics, with a little bit of scooping beneath immediate surface, feeling like conversation is going to die. and me: with fear of conversation dying (great fear, while writing i realize), spewing out some sort of ‘hey nice to meet you and maybe nice to live with you’ that isn’t coherent? then repeating in a watered-down: ‘hey gotta go’. socializing how do you do it..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a bit confined today. need to: read external things. go on walks. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>too much of a productivity log.</div>
<div>need to mess w brain. though trip and home back should have done this?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Dun dun I don't get you bum bum high Drew and drums </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Like you're a duckin genius in a stoner entrepreneurial way</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Boiler room</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Let's get smashty vashty rhymes </div>
<div>The noise of a truck, while imitating neighbor saying 'Oh the noise!'</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Vashty' new kicks All up in his grill </div>
<div>Wear one of each shows</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Fuck that bitch sounding elegant </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Sample Justin timber lake</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Need to write rhymes</div>
<div>Chill ass cab driver conversation flowing </div>
<div>Why do you think I didn't like Ike style </div>
<div>Lawn on d</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Make music that is scattered like brain </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Different layouts for portfolio </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Word of the day cut it</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The enterprise </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Negativity at the four tet concert</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Feeling mad skinny in my big shirt</div>
<div>An interminable 2 hour set </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>—retro— </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>7:30 on, a beautiful whir of banter. adam and i, outside, basketball court. scenic views, as a topic and as an observation: sunset draped over parking lot, basketball court. adam rocking gum-sole pumas, fresh green pants, black T. me, black stripes, vans, shorts. usual. angela walking by, no contacts, fresh from run. hi, hi. hat left at her house. even with cab driver, talking about drake/ovo and then just where we’re from, what we do. </div>
<div>overall state of mind - a whir a blur with spontaneous natural beautiful moments but: a whir. feeling now that, though groggy sort of night may play into state of mind, learning journey as human - if i’m feeling grounded and fine and good and sharp otherwise, likely better off sober.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>concert. meet w pete, black drop-crotch sweatpants, weird black fitted light odd-collar (turtle neck-y) and white cartoony shoes. err. (continuing my examination of pete / what it means to be with it, sharp, ‘present’ all the time. good thing). sort of like cyborg from invisibilia podcast yesterday - always remembering where a conversation last was, picking it up. allowing more depth, and continuous narrative with a person.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>anthony naples. beat. beat. lo-pass. beat. two hour set. ten seconds enough to drive siavash outside. enduring 1.2 hours, stepping out and joining. you need to cut iiiit. adam and i: might as well check out four tet. in for a bit, but bass way too loud  damage) upstairs.  10-15 min before leaving. siavash, pete leaving. would have enjoyed on a different night - at least more. but droning naples set, siavash’s negativity, comments (‘not though provoking music’, ‘not even that good’) making it difficult to give self up to music. dance, move, give the beat the benefit of the doubt.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>give the beat the benefit of the doubt. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at home w/ adam: discussing personality trait of being able to extract enjoyment, observations, or just endure really, unpleasant circumstance. current scenario, music unpleasant, mood not allowing the actual auditory enjoyment. but world-renowned artist here, influential producer. and the crowd he brings: people who share this one small interest. here, dancing, downtown, boston. enough to extract, i think.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this ‘i wanna go home’ inclination. get rid of it. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>from above - conversation snippets, somewhat out of context, interesting. need quicker way to access phone for typing..maybe just one raw note file.</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div>a few exchanges with girl from bumble. home, peeing, compulsively checking phone. during cab ride, uploading insta. hm. gratification through </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thoughts feelings conversations when high lucid when reading snippets of real-time writing. need to write to stay with it, when fucked up.</div>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5/26</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>wake up kinda horny but not that horny but staying in bed for 30 min, partly debating whether to sleep/get up, but mostly just scanning through people i know for a feel. (:s)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>gym. biking rowing circuit. remedy for sleep-deprivation, morning headache. tame impala carrying me through. mood not musical, so paying attention to subtle details, enveloping atmosphere. (new workout music pls)</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div>a journal can never be wrong b/c even when not feeling writing, when feeling, when thinking or not thinking about it too much - an expression of self is conveyed.</div>
<div><br/></div>

	<div>5/26</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>may in, thursday night.</div>

	<div>the day: d3, delving deeper into selections and (finally) getting line / scatter plot. realizing, could just rerun data.attr(‘d’, function(d){return d}) if data changed to refresh it (but will still consider this the same data / won’t create new groups). cool.</div>

	<div>basketball, shitty court. me and adam first, then two kids, one sikh. (sikh swag, a brief topic of convo.). knees, shins shaky, heading home.</div>

	<div>work, cooking, cleaning distractions.</div>

	<div>may over. energy level a bit low - me, adam, may contemplating food, initiating and creating sphere of conversation for latest life events: trip home, visit to southeast asia, finishing class. touching surface. at life alive, college dorm decor, brown alums.</div>

	<div>esplanade walk. with may: no apprehension about slow easing into conversation, knowing it will happen eventually.</div>

	<div>back home, seated on the table with vash (home, four shoes in hand). parallel conversations: siavash = superbug (huge interest, dream job = disease prevention?) and me, adam, may: rambunctious laughter (talking about?).</div>

	<div>Superbug</div>

	<div>Femme empowerment power</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>5/27 (fri, campus dance)</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>shower morning things</div>

	<div>nine bar sipping, munching outside (thinking of bartender’s perception of me = narcissist)</div>

	<div>en route. train ride zooming, chatting</div>

	<div>andrew’s new place. lunch @ red stripe. </div>

	<div>may to rugby house, me and andrew to hersh (a long walk, poor andrew)</div>

	<div>congdon. hersh in a cycle of laundry. omar and i outside, soaking sun on congdon green. meeting adam’s parents.</div>

	<div>then: others to dinner, me, hersh to benefit juice bar.</div>

	<div>gibberish (realizing, because hersh not understanding) about how interests are this weird sort of arbitrary thing, then juices (misunderstanding ordering). Beautiful (oh my god beautiful, upon exiting juice  bar) and walk near water and bridge and building in repair/disrepair. How are you doing, really? And a jump over platform </div>

	<div>more aware of need for validation from others and killing it before happening </div>

	<div>sprucing up at andrew’s, feeling like backstreet boy (formal wear w/ black t-shirt).</div>

	<div>may and kat over, a brief few puffs. kat, stoned stoned stoned. waiting for cab.</div>

	<div>pregame: meeting andrew’s friends. </div>

	<div>dance. may, then hersh &amp; co., and finally, jade. </div>

	<div>to jade’s. hanging at night (jordan there too) then shown the couch.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>5/28</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>emotional jello</div>

	<div>awful morning. awake at jade’s, hungover, shameful.</div>

	<div>breakfast. nourishment, though may and i carrying downtrodden mood.</div>

	<div>stef. (at some point, lying down, close together, strong urge to hook up). things lately. </div>

	<div>josh. brief. </div>

	<div>dubbs. </div>

	<div>may, jackie at tallulah’s. jackie’s recent emotional past.</div>

	<div>hersh and siavash at denden. siavash’s doctor shopping.</div>

	<div>then, congdon w hersh</div>

	<div>waterfire enchantment, sunset, and reflection.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>5/29</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>hanging w angela</div>

	<div>casey, weekend. Girls, of course. Affirming thoughts - jello, humiliation post weekend.</div>

	<div>sonja’s party. max and bearded friends.</div>

	<div>humiliation from fri night continuing to linger.</div><div>Nar and Adam, hi.</div>

	<div>stan smith pain</div>

	<div><br/></div><div>5/30</div><div><br/></div><div>Morning. Thoughts waking up before me, finding myself in puddle of negativity. Jade thing.</div><div>(Depression list)</div><div>How can these lists turn into a project that involve other people? Thought fragments at a bigger scale.</div><div><br/></div><div>Brain awakening</div><div>The post rain walk functioning in two ways. Small scale, recovering me weekend of negativity. Weirdness surrounding brown revisit, replaying life, ability to recall memories (did college float by), inability to materialize relationship w jade. Life now? Social life. What have I built? And a general paranoia of plummeting back into a depression.</div><div><br/></div><div>These thoughts. Dissolving, along with rain, cloudiness. Conversations with Angela - sort of practical, school decision, move. And probably odd bits and anecdotes. </div><div><br/></div><div>W Angela. Looking twice. At diesel briefly in the morning. Then at crib, and outside for walk.</div><div><br/></div><div>What if you just like sat naked with friends and got comfortable </div>

	<div><br/></div><div>Glasses forming like angry eyebrows. But glance exchange and a friendly smile. </div><div><br/></div><div>An excitement to move, actually.</div><div><br/></div><div>Josh. Polyamory. With woman who has 7 year old son.</div><div><br/></div><div>A bloc layout that becomes small </div><div>Serves as website map </div><div><br/></div><div>Display background noise as a data viz website, tags built into each thought</div><div><br/></div><div>As lists build, thoughts are structured, become narrative or list </div><div><br/></div><div>Like philosophical ramblings as basis for a list</div><div><br/></div><div>Marijuana stoned slipping </div><div><br/></div><div>Decrees lab and stereotypes </div><div><br/></div><div>Screening alive ac  </div>

<div>there. a stop at duane reade -&gt; smoking. watching rick and morty. plot line getting progressively more complex, but unraveling and winding in a brilliant way. can’t remember content, just nature of progression.</div>
<div>maybe upset (just a tinge) at face that may can’t make bday? and move-in? and leaving in a bit for LA. hm. all fair choices. can’t expect her to miss an entire weekend for me..</div>
<div>sleep, early wake up.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>write to live live to write.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5/31 - </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>move in. hour journey, suitcase over turnstiles.</div>
<div>sitting on steps, seeing lena walk by, bagel in hand. carrying sunshine. chatting, unpacking.</div>
<div>a bit of work.</div>
<div>apartment dingy, dirty. room, pretty good (though a little hot). aim of summer is, mainly to work. why did i leave comfy slow boston for dirty noisy fascinating brooklyn?</div>
<div>variety coffee shop. </div>
<div>stroll &amp; home. work.</div>
<div>robin. each of us buzzing with awkward energy. things like: being reformed slacker. canadian/arab. upbringing, conservative/racist in family strain, but parents liberal. travels, traveler vs tourist. the brain. the brain. consciousness. and my neuroscience research. invitation to crazy noise rock show, missing out.</div>
<div>may over, 9 pm. cooking dinner. resources low, kitchen small. a usual ambiguous not-curry not-stir-fry deal.</div>
<div>chance echoing.</div>
<div>immersed in talk of?</div>
<div>then, walking around the neighborhood. &amp; drinks.</div>
<div>a sort of timid energy around myself, an imaginary dynamic where may is feeling responsible for introduction to hood, cheering up? something like this?</div>
<div>not standing out, or trying not to stand out. how i’m profiled.</div>
<div>thinking of myself and my brain and my scatter-brain and when i should flex my scatter-brain</div>
<div>conversation with people &amp; strangers a sort of unimaginable thing. like how it lasts long. i mean i know..but how. i should ask the penetrating questions, but they’re not too? &lt;-thought unrelated to interactions, hanging chatting with may and robin, hours each.</div>
<div>apartment smells like seto's</div>
<div>foot pain and swelling</div>
<div>brooklyn weirdly bringing out jordan</div>
<div>brutalist websites</div>
<div>saying goodbye to may - man stopping us to ask for change, and spout absolute gibberish</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/1</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>coming = good choice. shift in mental energy.</div>
<div>morning. 6 hrs not enough, but up, up anyway. forcing food down. working for like only 1-1.5 hr, and then reading and re-reading paragraph.</div>
<div>gym. richie’s gym. enter: concrete, brutal building. no doors, just stores await. posters of upcoming fights scattered, only real decor.</div>
<div>third floor labeled, in tough, thick caps font ‘third floor’. into richie’s a brooklyn bro-type and latino guy running the place. clientele: almost all hispanic and black. many buff buff dudes. weights, old, rusty. but the basics there.</div>
<div>across, elevate train tracks. level.</div>
<div>this is brooklyn, can get widdit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back home, shower, cook chicken. on chair in kitchen, laptop in front, chicken sizzling. nestled, huddled, pseudo-working.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>not 2 much success w dating apps..but like one message from sort of cute risd grad</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>out to coffee shops. first: bushwick public house. one of three clients. waiter barista person, asian, delightful, confident. talking to dutch (?) transplant. then putting on action movie, watching. next to me, black girl, short hair, typing away. and people coming and going on the way. one guy familiar w dutch man, quick conversation about football. but maybe not dutch because then waiter practicing french w him? (outside: the elevate train tracks).</div>
<div>others coming in on bikes.</div>
<div>then: dweebs. small, andro barista. clientele crazy hip, bunny shoes emblematic. looking at designy things on their laptops. words exchanged: ‘oh no, these are my headphones, i think. the cord is wrapped’. all black, flip-flop wearing woman leaving to smoke cigarette outside, after meeting with timid man who asked about my headphones. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home —&gt; working. progressively more productive.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>brooklyn as the perfect unsustainable utopia really. all people interested in creative things + others who are generally cool, want to be around coolness, and will live gritty life to be part of it. amazing .. (thought is deeper than description here)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>explosions in sky song, listening to now, culminating in crazy crazy feedback-induced high-pitched crescendo. head down, taking it in. then song stopping, at once, back to writing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>do i really want to go back to work? maybe just try to move here. why arcadia, really? but arcadia: need to keep up, send message or something.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>things to see. music. things to do. talk to people.</div>
<div>(really should write in day. or when high. but not when tired)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thought catalog project a bit more concrete. thoughts floating from central semantic nodes, but all invisible. sort of floating around. then adding filters to organize. hm. how were filters more concrete? thoughts sifted in lists, perhaps?</div>
<div>how can i make this beautiful and not just structural.</div>
<div>(get loopy and start categorizing patterns)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>when you know songs too well, the feeling today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sometimes i think ‘i’m not going to forget this i’m not i’m not’ and do.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work log:</div>
<div>css layout, all day. all day. float and clear-fix. grasping. fixing my little webpage, aligning things properly. table format, other formats. relative and absolute positioning. in the brain. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>kids don’t say to adults ‘i love adults’. we’re so reductive.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>cs examples (enter text here) as a manifestation of the conscious subconscious</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>book store - molasses</div>
<div>a sign in the restroom ‘jiggle handle if still running’. casual, real. things becoming charming when everything works too well.</div>
<div>mindfulness not needed when things are in your face.</div>
<div>a chat about - poetry book related to logic. generative poetry based on images. (the programmer artist)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home. checking - coffee shops? then, no, i can stay here. 10 minutes later, still checking coffee shops - so fuck it / leave</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>food simple. this cooked and thrown on this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>bloc, breezing through checkpoints. so far not very worthwhile.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>rest of day.</div>
<div>home and home - cooking, calling nabil.</div>
<div>nabil + marriage. how he sees it as commitment, effort, work. and that’s what he loves</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then chat w kareem.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and - again. the shoe size dilemma. just. fucking. size. up?</div>
<div>wow. a 3 hour </div>
<div>talk w kareem</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>standing may up</div>
<div>at the bar</div>
<div>turtle</div>
<div>chats</div>
<div>etc etc</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/3 (birthday :o)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>calls from: stef. quite nice. mainly talking about friends from home (nabil’s marriage). how rosie is doing, and tash. marriage, cultural expectations.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on hold w bank of america. hold hold hold, card declined earlier.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a beautiful message from hersh. unlikelihood of us meeting. then: down to earth, witty, creatively talented, and arab/american. him + others thinking i’m a great individual. wow..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a continuation of destructive indecisiveness. buying shoes (8.5), fly jordan’s from shoe store near bushwick/williamsburg. can only try one shoe at a time - with grumpy shopkeeper doling out individual shoes (people run off w shoes, crazy). feeling embarrassed, unable to make decision, until worker basically like ‘just get the 8.5 man’. the 9 bending. but 8.5 too tight on fat right foot. and then home. lesson from stan smith: just size up, and get an insole if needed really. but. wanting. shoes. now. so wearing around house. googling ‘shoe sizing’. all with awareness of how stupid this is, how i’ve done the same thing multiple times..and now, settling on most likely keeping/stretching out b/c canvas?</div>
<div>just. fucking. size. up?</div>
<div>(two-sock method, it turns, worked out, and shoes really did stretch out..hm. confusing, though feeling like less of idiot)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>indecision yielding to deep tiredness, falling asleep, exchanging small talk w robin.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>earlier: working at variety. sort of productive, though course quite dry / not practical now. and no communication from mentor.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(the day, overall, drifting by. finally, resolve to get outside (walk) and casey over just shortly after..</div>
<div>manhattan? williamsburg first. rocking new shoes, feet tight, uncomfortable (should have, should have sized up), baseball-like shirt, black fancy pants. a rather sharp look i think. drink at bourguious place. crowd older, polished. walking, wandering, then - lower east side. scanning streets, few times. </div>
<div>(patchi bailing on bar meet up)</div>
<div>guy named derrick sending us business card promising open bar in hotel. hit a few places, semi-dance/drink, then, like 1am, hotel chantelle. </div>
<div>a long line, skeptical that card will work. bouncer smiles, lets us in.</div>
<div>and derrik, in corner, pouring drinks. birthday, it turns out. 36. many other strangers there? confusing, interesting, situation overall. some swaying before making way back home.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>don’t expect don’t expect in depth calls for bday. friends mostly forgetting, that’s normal natural and i do the same. though the people who do remember, give half-hearted: yo happy bday, like maliha = hm guess we’ve drifted? a message from jade at night, saying - let’s hang out sometime this summer, no worries about drunken night. birthday feelings a recurrence, it seems.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back home ready sleep</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/4</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10:40ish shower up out to park slope - alex rapport’s. (and also, dan, evan)</div>
<div>beautiful, utopian park slope. and tasteful, young intellectual apartment. the structure: sunlight, exposed brick, fresh wooden floors, walls with pre-built character. and furnishment: red table, bright chairs. books books trinkets. should really craigslist harder, thinking..</div>
<div>hi hi to alex what have you been up to. dan in kitchen, preparing waffles. evan rising, following waffle waft shortly after.</div>
<div>diner. vitality, wakefulness w food and coffee. lena alex casey. paralegal life, while waiting for lena. last nights. a happy belated birthday - and casey’s realization that it was my birthday. then lena. gig painting for someone with parkinson’s. &amp; &amp; ..</div>
<div>back to alex’s. chatting to dan about freelance photography life, luring everyone to come to prospect park.</div>
<div>prospect park. around us, mixed crowd, older than bushwick. on blanket, semi-sunny spot, evan playing kaytranada. direct view, bikers struggling to make it up hill. beers, conversation, sun soaking. and frisbee with wesleyan 27 yr old bros.</div>
<div>retreating, sweaty.</div>
<div>a present, flowing not thinking all that much sort of state of mind.</div>
<div>recharge: shower, espresso shot</div>
<div>brooklyn museum first saturday.</div>
<div>inside, family-friendly bumpin. everyone dancing. things like: rihanna/work with heavier drums. beautiful scene, varied economic class it looks, super mixed. outside &amp; projections. writing down thoughts on gentrification - though like are these white people not gentrifiers? or is this primarily on landlord? lena’s gf, shannon, beautiful, engaging, strong eye contact, and happy birthday upon meeting. oh wow amazing hi nice to meet you. and friends: one working at warby parker, and gf who recently quit job.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>saving topics of conversation. a weird thing. do others do this? big things like love/dating</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>life here different pace here different thought pattern different..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>gentrification = the topic. problem = capitalism rewarding money, landlords charging more and more. gov should either reimburse rent differences or force rent control. cool white artsy people who can’t afford nice housing move and hip-ify area -&gt; area = cooler, others w more money attracted -&gt; rent increasing -&gt; residents leaving. needs macro level control, since the money that comes late in gentrification (primarily from businesspeople working away from area that they are gentrifying) doesn’t go directly to gov (and therefore cannot be fed into rent control). instead to companies, outside towns. and money not to local businesses, but new fresh businesses.</div>
<div>my musings, thoughts.</div>
<div>gentrification in some ways inevitable, but need to be mindful, avoid eating at the super hip, support local restaurants and run-down stores.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>post museum, staring at fountain.</div>
<div>burger. dan like - i’m really glad you’re here. caught off guard with noticement, niceness.</div>
<div>bars in crown heights. first, soul night at mostly hip clean place. music a bit too low-key, but a few jamming hard. leaving in search of more bass.</div>
<div>picking up lost ring + rewarded with instant make-out. and later, rejection.</div>
<div>dance dance</div>
<div>patchi &amp; hate for ny, long distance relationship, past few weeks in the city.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>franklin park, the bar. a sort of truce ground. gentrifiers, local community there. an even within locals: spectrum. some people </div>
<div>one orthodox jew, and, anna zeidman’s bumble date, walking in with infinite jest in hand.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/5</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>james blake / music to awaken, ground me. not much time to listen to music lately.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>when the environment is the focus:</div>
<div>reflection, set behind, can’t keep up w present</div>
<div>forgetting about life. the elements of life that constitute continuity. family.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>down about love. low tinder / bumble / real life success. hit gym hard, feel better + more secure?</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>Mentor meeting - hypothesizing rest of course</div>

<div>High and thoughts racing </div>
<div>Racing </div>
<div>Excited about things in making </div>
<div>Trumpets in rap nostalgia </div>
<div>May by my side </div>
<div>Stepping back </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thank god 6/8 not 6/9 b/c then less journaling</div>
<div>heavens</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>walking may to the train station in circular route. this neighborhood. the almost orchestrated grit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the bushwhack hipsters and yearning for an earlier fictional nostalgic age</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>smoking robin’s ‘awake’ weed</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>loving casey’s bro’s website. blue popping font and beautiful typeface type shit</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>them too big air jordan 1’s can’t return humiliation </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hm thought / background noise not seeming legitimate. journal as a source of data?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>portfolio project classifications </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the usual thought of fluid personality resonating after an article of similar opinion</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>news checks shorter in new york. music, free time, things, shorter. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>too busy to talk to myself</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/9</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>refreshed &amp; born - but not sure why</div>
<div>day feeling - stifled. unsure where to work.</div>
<div>first tour at co-working spaces. one like okay but really 25/day?</div>
<div>and then air jordan 1 i couldn’t return b/c tried on too hard (really) hurting feet and feet hurt and i have made no progress in that front</div>
<div>(sat morning = shopping !) or thurs or some other day</div>
<div>but working spaces not working so nearby cafe instead, twin peaks themed. aka few twin peaks posters.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>20-25 min walk from myrtle-wychoff but people different. less grunge hipster (though present present). odd business-men or old ladies saying dear. williamsburg-looking older people. white. guy wearing raggedy clothing, talking about some sort of manual labor? portugese girl near me mixing languages elegantly. guy and woman, not dating (most likely). guy devouring devouring bagel. not just hungry or eating fast. but focused. looking at bagel. choosing the right posture/stance to maximize bite. other woman joining after. little comments made, many with bagel in mouth. focused on people </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>self-esteem maybe going up with few more tinder matches (really) &amp; realizing bumble has weird ranking system that throws people who either 1) don’t respond or 2) mass swipe (me) to bottom of pile. hmkay.</div>
<div>how to start conversations, now..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back to dweeb’s. the spot. energy level perfect. nearby, semi-flamboyant tall blonde in tank + black hair black black + denim tats u know the type talking about ‘shows’. dude organizing burlesque shows? hm. clients. dancers &amp; descriptions, amid bloc.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>continuing w/ bloc jams. jQuery refactor. useful tidbit of day: setting function as listener - w parameters - without calling function. basically .click(function() {function w params}) type of thing. seeing that foundation is helping me shortcut through some things i would have googled over and over, props will help me structure apps more quickly. trouble following directions though, program working but diverging from bloc’s. (play-pause-next functionality in bloc-jams..)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>music cafe hipster grunge 2 much in head</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home. laundry. mexican music blasting (blasting everywhere really..whizzing through my head, further disorienting).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>getting high last night helping me realize realize really where i am. like looking around brooklyn wow zah.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>—being refreshed. on that. laundry. drying cycle: disappearing into article about school segregation. ny incredibly segregated, little policy trying to fight this. but anyway. heat from drying machines. phone screen. physical sensations. but rapt in article. then home and - music. oo ah relaxing music not from cafes chosen by me. dj koze. laundry away, impromptu room reshuffling (hey this nice can work here). food. really standard mundane but needed - space - music - ability to reflect - to feel good.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5/11 (sat)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>11am up, slight hangover </div>
<div>Making toast</div>
<div>Complex toast, Sabrina calls it. Burnt (yes, intentionally) cinnamon; peanut butter, banana.</div>
<div>Sabrina up.</div>
<div>Naked and in bed. Cuddling, listening to: a fan-induced squeak. Poster rattling on walk. Sounding like: starving kitten. Sounds from street shuffling in. Hispanic music, conversation, birds. Cries. Things.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Checking time: 3:30. Oh shit. A tiger shirt (complement) &amp; preparations to leave. Breakfast at: dweebs. There the conversation like: friends smart and friends theses and some really shitty instagram experimental theses. Sabrina: rhetorical analysis of language used by peta, similarity to civil rights movement. Me: not zapping monkeys. Talking to strangers. &amp;&amp;</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Back home: finding a tootsie pop on desk. Emptied from pockets. Indicator of: memory loss. Or nature of it. Because when sober, you expect to forget many trivial things (when you went to bathroom for ex) - but not forget how tootsie pop was lost. What's feeding perception of memory </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/12</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Morning hi robin and friends then gym</div>
<div>Working at kave. Coffee shop nestled in small hip complex. </div>
<div>Delving into 1 hour convo with two native Manhattan parents. Prompted by: 'you, what do you do for a living?'. As in, why are you working at this coffee shop?  Explaining explaining listening. Women: makes puppets now. Used to be audio engineer for brain eno. Worked at bank, did other things. Now tho, puppets and newspaper clippings. Husband, fitness trainer (shows). (Recalling a women's envy: 'you just do what you want')</div>
<div>Yay conversations with strangers</div>
<div>Like I'm opening up </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Stopping by robin's bike shop. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Boiler room. Well shmancy dinner w may, Greenpoint. Looking like Park Slope.</div>
<div>Following experimental edm bro, guy with turntable tatted playing abrasive beats. Getting places with experiment tho, and eventually bringing on flamboyant passionate rapper. </div>
<div>Show begins.</div>
<div>Dance 4 hours</div>
<div>Hi Ryan Glassman</div>
<div>Hi Emma's friends</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/13 </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Portfolio design.</div>
<div>Meeting may at dweeb's and ah I can't take this. Until 5:30. </div>
<div>Then more.</div>
<div>Combo of: sketch designs, physical sketch, scattered notes, and portfolio oogling.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At night: browsing pretty vertical scrolly portfolio's that take user through linear narrative. And like: is this just better?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Too many design thoughts in bed </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/14</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Portfolio design continuing. </div>
<div>At the moment; no longer hating 3D diagonal card arrangement. Could be a unique site. </div>
<div>Cobalt blue font, fold out pages </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Through Brownsville </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Running to L train in Brownsville, knocking blind lady's cane. In a blur, flylo playing through, apologies sprouting </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Crown heights</div>
<div>Sharon's place - for July / $580 a month. Clean nice near museum. Wide street. Orthodox Jews </div>
<div>The word: thickly settled.</div>
<div>to the left, black people to right.</div>
<div>Dominican food in crowded mini restaurant. Asking man, 'what to order?'</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/15 and 6/16</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Morning spirit lifted a bit as design is affirmed for website. Designing about page, content, then semi working w Jekyll. </div>
<div>Nap then to </div>
<div>Mays</div>
<div>2 full express trains, missing. Noting graphic design of signs.</div>
<div>College kids in</div>
<div>A sort of half greeting from the girls. Marshall and Grif super friendly. Also incidentally tripping.</div>
<div>Milling about and wondering where to put my body.</div>
<div>Waiting waiting stalled by joints </div>
<div>Then out the door</div>
<div>Trains</div>
<div>Feeling long</div>
<div>At prospect park a beautiful beautiful day </div>
<div>Debating tripping and deciding no </div>
<div>Inside the park venue</div>
<div>Worrying about tickets then finding a place to sit, smoke. Getting instantly high (Popsicle taste intensifying as evidence) and deciding: half a tab.</div>
<div>Eventually crowd wandering, separated behind may Amanda by tall dude. Near the becky's little bro who just finished high school. </div>
<div>An opening band that the crowd liked but was somewhat irritating. French. Layers not melding. Glad I have taste still on acid.</div>
<div>Crowd paranoia. Is everyone looking at me, laughing at me? Talking about me? Knowing that can't be true but it feels like it..</div>
<div>Tame impala finally on.</div>
<div>At first currents I think.</div>
<div>Thinking: damn they got some beats. Really. And getting down.</div>
<div>Mind mischief </div>
<div>Beginning to 'confront' issues: </div>
<div>Sharing a ridiculous thought and may like shaking head. And then feeling stupid. I shouldn't feel bad. This is okay. A sort of feigned lucidity?</div>
<div>Sensitive to: may's acknowledgement of me. Things I say, how others perceive me.</div>
<div> like everyone is watching laughing talking about me. I know it's not real but seeing it happen, subtly. </div>
<div>Getting down to: why won't she talk to me? Others too. Lyrics so drawn out and just swaying singing to me.</div>
<div>Brain wandering in?</div>
<div>Weird animations</div>
<div>This beautiful beautiful young looking but I think my age girl. Face perfect.</div>
<div>Again - try to talk to may. I l think share something funny? Or trivial but like a hey here's a piece of my brain. Shot down. May looking at crooked hat. Confiscating, and not asking about anything else.</div>
<div>Hm okay.</div>
<div>How I can sort of imagine interactions w people.</div>
<div>Not really feeling warmth. From this crew. hm.</div>
<div>Maybe trip was normal? but at some point, exploring every open crevice in brain.</div>
<div>May wanting to head outside crowd. So much a part of music right now I'm not even listening to it. So yes.</div>
<div>Outside. Alternatingly sitting and standing. Enjoying music at both paces. Feeling air. And pulled in.</div>
<div>The concert actually really great. not wanting to end. Feels like we only go backwards.</div>
<div>Really sort of contemplating tame impala lyrics. Or for certain songs where mind went all over the place. Like is this song. That's amazing if it allowed my mind to wander like that..</div>
<div>But thinking</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Leaving concert to go to Hope's car. Straightedge. In a sort of wasteland in the city? Cars, only.</div>
<div>Then, in park slope. Recognizing area.</div>
<div>Figuring out trains, eventually.</div>
<div>The Q home comfortable but feeling like I'm pulling body together.</div>
<div>Listening to: now and for next few hours, camp talk.</div>
<div>Falafel guys. Egyptian guy practicing English and joking. Asking 'where you from?' To clearly white American girl.</div>
<div>Body </div>
<div>The same intense urge to pull skin out.</div>
<div>Waiting for bed.</div>
<div>W may, fidgeting so much it drives her to couch.</div>
<div>Notice this, in the morning. And feeling bad regretful my brain was fine fine should I always welcome disruption like this?</div>
<div>Clenching </div>
<div>Feeling face bone structure </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/16 morning </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A bit defeated. In a nothing can satisfy mood. Walking on street and pace is odd, noticing and zooming on people.  </div>
<div>A bit better as I write about trip</div>
<div>Wasn't like bad</div>
<div>Just mentally exhausting.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<hr/>
<div>5/30 - </div>
<div>getting to may’s.</div>
<div>there. a stop at duane reade -&gt; smoking. watching rick and morty. plot line getting progressively more complex, but unraveling and winding in a brilliant way. can’t remember content, just nature of progression.</div>
<div>maybe upset (just a tinge) at face that may can’t make bday? and move-in? and leaving in a bit for LA. hm. all fair choices. can’t expect her to miss an entire weekend for me..</div>
<div>sleep, early wake up.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>write to live live to write.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5/31 - </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>move in. hour journey, suitcase over turnstiles.</div>
<div>sitting on steps, seeing lena walk by, bagel in hand. carrying sunshine. chatting, unpacking.</div>
<div>a bit of work.</div>
<div>apartment dingy, dirty. room, pretty good (though a little hot). aim of summer is, mainly to work. why did i leave comfy slow boston for dirty noisy fascinating brooklyn?</div>
<div>variety coffee shop. </div>
<div>stroll &amp; home. work.</div>
<div>robin. each of us buzzing with awkward energy. things like: being reformed slacker. canadian/arab. upbringing, conservative/racist in family strain, but parents liberal. travels, traveler vs tourist. the brain. the brain. consciousness. and my neuroscience research. invitation to crazy noise rock show, missing out.</div>
<div>may over, 9 pm. cooking dinner. resources low, kitchen small. a usual ambiguous not-curry not-stir-fry deal.</div>
<div>chance echoing.</div>
<div>immersed in talk of?</div>
<div>then, walking around the neighborhood. &amp; drinks.</div>
<div>a sort of timid energy around myself, an imaginary dynamic where may is feeling responsible for introduction to hood, cheering up? something like this?</div>
<div>not standing out, or trying not to stand out. how i’m profiled.</div>
<div>thinking of myself and my brain and my scatter-brain and when i should flex my scatter-brain</div>
<div>conversation with people &amp; strangers a sort of unimaginable thing. like how it lasts long. i mean i know..but how. i should ask the penetrating questions, but they’re not too? &lt;-thought unrelated to interactions, hanging chatting with may and robin, hours each.</div>
<div>apartment smells like seto's</div>
<div>foot pain and swelling</div>
<div>brooklyn weirdly bringing out jordan</div>
<div>brutalist websites</div>
<div>saying goodbye to may - man stopping us to ask for change, and spout absolute gibberish</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/1</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>coming = good choice. shift in mental energy.</div>
<div>morning. 6 hrs not enough, but up, up anyway. forcing food down. working for like only 1-1.5 hr, and then reading and re-reading paragraph.</div>
<div>gym. richie’s gym. enter: concrete, brutal building. no doors, just stores await. posters of upcoming fights scattered, only real decor.</div>
<div>third floor labeled, in tough, thick caps font ‘third floor’. into richie’s a brooklyn bro-type and latino guy running the place. clientele: almost all hispanic and black. many buff buff dudes. weights, old, rusty. but the basics there.</div>
<div>across, elevate train tracks. level.</div>
<div>this is brooklyn, can get widdit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back home, shower, cook chicken. on chair in kitchen, laptop in front, chicken sizzling. nestled, huddled, pseudo-working.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>not 2 much success w dating apps..but like one message from sort of cute risd grad</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>out to coffee shops. first: bushwick public house. one of three clients. waiter barista person, asian, delightful, confident. talking to dutch (?) transplant. then putting on action movie, watching. next to me, black girl, short hair, typing away. and people coming and going on the way. one guy familiar w dutch man, quick conversation about football. but maybe not dutch because then waiter practicing french w him? (outside: the elevate train tracks).</div>
<div>others coming in on bikes.</div>
<div>then: dweebs. small, andro barista. clientele crazy hip, bunny shoes emblematic. looking at designy things on their laptops. words exchanged: ‘oh no, these are my headphones, i think. the cord is wrapped’. all black, flip-flop wearing woman leaving to smoke cigarette outside, after meeting with timid man who asked about my headphones. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home —&gt; working. progressively more productive.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>brooklyn as the perfect unsustainable utopia really. all people interested in creative things + others who are generally cool, want to be around coolness, and will live gritty life to be part of it. amazing .. (thought is deeper than description here)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>explosions in sky song, listening to now, culminating in crazy crazy feedback-induced high-pitched crescendo. head down, taking it in. then song stopping, at once, back to writing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>do i really want to go back to work? maybe just try to move here. why arcadia, really? but arcadia: need to keep up, send message or something.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>things to see. music. things to do. talk to people.</div>
<div>(really should write in day. or when high. but not when tired)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thought catalog project a bit more concrete. thoughts floating from central semantic nodes, but all invisible. sort of floating around. then adding filters to organize. hm. how were filters more concrete? thoughts sifted in lists, perhaps?</div>
<div>how can i make this beautiful and not just structural.</div>
<div>(get loopy and start categorizing patterns)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>when you know songs too well, the feeling today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sometimes i think ‘i’m not going to forget this i’m not i’m not’ and do.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work log:</div>
<div>css layout, all day. all day. float and clear-fix. grasping. fixing my little webpage, aligning things properly. table format, other formats. relative and absolute positioning. in the brain. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>kids don’t say to adults ‘i love adults’. we’re so reductive.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>cs examples (enter text here) as a manifestation of the conscious subconscious</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>book store - molasses</div>
<div>a sign in the restroom ‘jiggle handle if still running’. casual, real. things becoming charming when everything works too well.</div>
<div>mindfulness not needed when things are in your face.</div>
<div>a chat about - poetry book related to logic. generative poetry based on images. (the programmer artist)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home. checking - coffee shops? then, no, i can stay here. 10 minutes later, still checking coffee shops - so fuck it / leave</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>food simple. this cooked and thrown on this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>bloc, breezing through checkpoints. so far not very worthwhile.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>rest of day.</div>
<div>home and home - cooking, calling nabil.</div>
<div>nabil + marriage. how he sees it as commitment, effort, work. and that’s what he loves</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then chat w kareem.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and - again. the shoe size dilemma. just. fucking. size. up?</div>
<div>wow. a 3 hour </div>
<div>talk w kareem</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>standing may up</div>
<div>at the bar</div>
<div>turtle</div>
<div>chats</div>
<div>etc etc</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/3 (birthday :o)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>calls from: stef. quite nice. mainly talking about friends from home (nabil’s marriage). how rosie is doing, and tash. marriage, cultural expectations.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on hold w bank of america. hold hold hold, card declined earlier.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a beautiful message from harsh. unlikelihood of us meeting. then: down to earth, witty, creatively talented, and arab/american. him + others thinking i’m a great individual. wow..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a continuation of destructive indecisiveness. buying shoes (8.5), fly jordan’s from shoe store near bushwick/williamsburg. can only try one shoe at a time - with grumpy shopkeeper doling out individual shoes (people run off w shoes, crazy). feeling embarrassed, unable to make decision, until worker basically like ‘just get the 8.5 man’. the 9 bending. but 8.5 too tight on fat right foot. and then home. lesson from stan smith: just size up, and get an insole if needed really. but. wanting. shoes. now. so wearing around house. googling ‘shoe sizing’. all with awareness of how stupid this is, how i’ve done the same thing multiple times..and now, settling on most likely keeping/stretching out b/c canvas?</div>
<div>just. fucking. size. up?</div>
<div>(two-sock method, it turns, worked out, and shoes really did stretch out..hm. confusing, though feeling like less of idiot)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>indecision yielding to deep tiredness, falling asleep, exchanging small talk w robin.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>earlier: working at variety. sort of productive, though course quite dry / not practical now. and no communication from mentor.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(the day, overall, drifting by. finally, resolve to get outside (walk) and casey over just shortly after..</div>
<div>manhattan? williamsburg first. rocking new shoes, feet tight, uncomfortable (should have, should have sized up), baseball-like shirt, black fancy pants. a rather sharp look i think. drink at bourguious place. crowd older, polished. walking, wandering, then - lower east side. scanning streets, few times. </div>
<div>(patchi bailing on bar meet up)</div>
<div>guy named derrick sending us business card promising open bar in hotel. hit a few places, semi-dance/drink, then, like 1am, hotel chantelle. </div>
<div>a long line, skeptical that card will work. bouncer smiles, lets us in.</div>
<div>and derrik, in corner, pouring drinks. birthday, it turns out. 36. many other strangers there? confusing, interesting, situation overall. some swaying before making way back home.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>don’t expect don’t expect in depth calls for bday. friends mostly forgetting, that’s normal natural and i do the same. though the people who do remember, give half-hearted: yo happy bday, like maliha = hm guess we’ve drifted? a message from jade at night, saying - let’s hang out sometime this summer, no worries about drunken night. birthday feelings a recurrence, it seems.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back home ready sleep</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/4</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10:40ish shower up out to park slope - alex rapport’s. (and also, dan, evan)</div>
<div>beautiful, utopian park slope. and tasteful, young intellectual apartment. the structure: sunlight, exposed brick, fresh wooden floors, walls with pre-built character. and furnishment: red table, bright chairs. books books trinkets. should really craigslist harder, thinking..</div>
<div>hi hi to alex what have you been up to. dan in kitchen, preparing waffles. evan rising, following waffle waft shortly after.</div>
<div>diner. vitality, wakefulness w food and coffee. lena alex casey. paralegal life, while waiting for lena. last nights. a happy belated birthday - and casey’s realization that it was my birthday. then lena. gig painting for someone with parkinson’s. &amp; &amp; ..</div>
<div>back to alex’s. chatting to dan about freelance photography life, luring everyone to come to prospect park.</div>
<div>prospect park. around us, mixed crowd, older than bushwick. on blanket, semi-sunny spot, evan playing kaytranada. direct view, bikers struggling to make it up hill. beers, conversation, sun soaking. and frisbee with wesleyan 27 yr old bros.</div>
<div>retreating, sweaty.</div>
<div>a present, flowing not thinking all that much sort of state of mind.</div>
<div>recharge: shower, espresso shot</div>
<div>brooklyn museum first saturday.</div>
<div>inside, family-friendly bumpin. everyone dancing. things like: rihanna/work with heavier drums. beautiful scene, varied economic class it looks, super mixed. outside &amp; projections. writing down thoughts on gentrification - though like are these white people not gentrifiers? or is this primarily on landlord? lena’s gf, shannon, beautiful, engaging, strong eye contact, and happy birthday upon meeting. oh wow amazing hi nice to meet you. and friends: one working at warby parker, and gf who recently quit job.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>saving topics of conversation. a weird thing. do others do this? big things like love/dating</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>life here different pace here different thought pattern different..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>gentrification = the topic. problem = capitalism rewarding money, landlords charging more and more. gov should either reimburse rent differences or force rent control. cool white artsy people who can’t afford nice housing move and hip-ify area -&gt; area = cooler, others w more money attracted -&gt; rent increasing -&gt; residents leaving. needs macro level control, since the money that comes late in gentrification (primarily from businesspeople working away from area that they are gentrifying) doesn’t go directly to gov (and therefore cannot be fed into rent control). instead to companies, outside towns. and money not to local businesses, but new fresh businesses.</div>
<div>my musings, thoughts.</div>
<div>gentrification in some ways inevitable, but need to be mindful, avoid eating at the super hip, support local restaurants and run-down stores.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>post museum, staring at fountain.</div>
<div>burger. dan like - i’m really glad you’re here. caught off guard with noticement, niceness.</div>
<div>bars in crown heights. first, soul night at mostly hip clean place. music a bit too low-key, but a few jamming hard. leaving in search of more bass.</div>
<div>picking up lost ring + rewarded with instant make-out. and later, rejection.</div>
<div>dance dance</div>
<div>patchi &amp; hate for ny, long distance relationship, past few weeks in the city.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>franklin park, the bar. a sort of truce ground. gentrifiers, local community there. an even within locals: spectrum. some people </div>
<div>one orthodox jew, and, anna zeidman’s bumble date, walking in with infinite jest in hand.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/5</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>james blake / music to awaken, ground me. not much time to listen to music lately.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>when the environment is the focus:</div>
<div>reflection, set behind, can’t keep up w present</div>
<div>forgetting about life. the elements of life that constitute continuity. family.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>down about love. low tinder / bumble / real life success. hit gym hard, feel better + more secure?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>dainty breakfast w casey at new hip place. where white people hide.</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>Mentor meeting - hypothesizing rest of course</div>
<div>Daryl in the morning. Move to nyc, not getting any, weirdness of campus dance. + home. The topics. Reciprocating w/: mays visit, hanging w Christian, fling and wanting to restrict fling.</div>

<div>Coursewise: DOM animation. Wee rotating text.</div>

<div>Junglepussy - bklyn feminist </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Things: distraction, again by shoes and shoe sizes, chats w robin, Ana, now trip to mays</div>

<div>High and thoughts racing </div>
<div>Racing </div>
<div>Excited about things in making </div>
<div>Trumpets in rap nostalgia </div>
<div>May by my side </div>
<div>Stepping back </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thank god 6/8 not 6/9 b/c then less journaling</div>
<div>heavens</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>walking may to the train station in circular route. this neighborhood. the almost orchestrated grit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the bushwhack hipsters and yearning for an earlier fictional nostalgic age</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>smoking robin’s ‘awake’ weed</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>loving casey’s bro’s website. blue popping font and beautiful typeface type shit</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>them too big air jordan 1’s can’t return humiliation </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hm thought / background noise not seeming legitimate. journal as a source of data?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>portfolio project classifications </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the usual thought of fluid personality resonating after an article of similar opinion</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>news checks shorter in new york. music, free time, things, shorter. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>too busy to talk to myself</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/9</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>refreshed &amp; born - but not sure why</div>
<div>day feeling - stifled. unsure where to work.</div>
<div>first tour at co-working spaces. one like okay but really 25/day?</div>
<div>and then air jordan 1 i couldn’t return b/c tried on too hard (really) hurting feet and feet hurt and i have made no progress in that front</div>
<div>(sat morning = shopping !) or thurs or some other day</div>
<div>but working spaces not working so nearby cafe instead, twin peaks themed. aka few twin peaks posters.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>20-25 min walk from myrtle-wychoff but people different. less grunge hipster (though present present). odd business-men or old ladies saying dear. williamsburg-looking older people. white. guy wearing raggedy clothing, talking about some sort of manual labor? portugese girl near me mixing languages elegantly. guy and woman, not dating (most likely). guy devouring devouring bagel. not just hungry or eating fast. but focused. looking at bagel. choosing the right posture/stance to maximize bite. other woman joining after. little comments made, many with bagel in mouth. focused on people </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>self-esteem maybe going up with few more tinder matches (really) &amp; realizing bumble has weird ranking system that throws people who either 1) don’t respond or 2) mass swipe (me) to bottom of pile. hmkay.</div>
<div>how to start conversations, now..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back to dweeb’s. the spot. energy level perfect. nearby, semi-flamboyant tall blonde in tank + black hair black black + denim tats u know the type talking about ‘shows’. dude organizing burlesque shows? hm. clients. dancers &amp; descriptions, amid bloc.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>continuing w/ bloc jams. jQuery refactor. useful tidbit of day: setting function as listener - w parameters - without calling function. basically .click(function() {function w params}) type of thing. seeing that foundation is helping me shortcut through some things i would have googled over and over, props will help me structure apps more quickly. trouble following directions though, program working but diverging from bloc’s. (play-pause-next functionality in bloc-jams..)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>music cafe hipster grunge 2 much in head</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home. laundry. mexican music blasting (blasting everywhere really..whizzing through my head, further disorienting).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>getting high last night helping me realize realize really where i am. like looking around brooklyn wow zah.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>—being refreshed. on that. laundry. drying cycle: disappearing into article about school segregation. ny incredibly segregated, little policy trying to fight this. but anyway. heat from drying machines. phone screen. physical sensations. but rapt in article. then home and - music. oo ah relaxing music not from cafes chosen by me. dj koze. laundry away, impromptu room reshuffling (hey this nice can work here). food. really standard mundane but needed - space - music - ability to reflect - to feel good.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5/11 (sat)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>11am up, slight hangover </div>
<div>Making toast</div>
<div>Complex toast, Sabrina calls it. Burnt (yes, intentionally) cinnamon; peanut butter, banana.</div>
<div>Sabrina up.</div>
<div>Naked and in bed. Cuddling, listening to: a fan-induced squeak. Poster rattling on walk. Sounding like: starving kitten. Sounds from street shuffling in. Hispanic music, conversation, birds. Cries. Things.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Checking time: 3:30. Oh shit. A tiger shirt (complement) &amp; preparations to leave. Breakfast at: dweebs. There the conversation like: friends smart and friends theses and some really shitty instagram experimental theses. Sabrina: rhetorical analysis of language used by peta, similarity to civil rights movement. Me: not zapping monkeys. Talking to strangers. &amp;&amp;</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Back home: finding a tootsie pop on desk. Emptied from pockets. Indicator of: memory loss. Or nature of it. Because when sober, you expect to forget many trivial things (when you went to bathroom for ex) - but not forget how tootsie pop was lost. What's feeding perception of memory </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/12</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Morning hi robin and friends then gym</div>
<div>Working at kave. Coffee shop nestled in small hip complex. </div>
<div>Delving into 1 hour convo with two native Manhattan parents. Prompted by: 'you, what do you do for a living?'. As in, why are you working at this coffee shop?  Explaining explaining listening. Women: makes puppets now. Used to be audio engineer for brain eno. Worked at bank, did other things. Now tho, puppets and newspaper clippings. Husband, fitness trainer (shows). (Recalling a women's envy: 'you just do what you want')</div>
<div>Yay conversations with strangers</div>
<div>Like I'm opening up </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Stopping by robin's bike shop. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Boiler room. Well shmancy dinner w may, Greenpoint. Looking like Park Slope.</div>
<div>Following experimental edm bro, guy with turntable tatted playing abrasive beats. Getting places with experiment tho, and eventually bringing on flamboyant passionate rapper. </div>
<div>Show begins.</div>
<div>Dance 4 hours</div>
<div>Hi Ryan Glassman</div>
<div>Hi Emma's friends</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/13 </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Portfolio design.</div>
<div>Meeting may at dweeb's and ah I can't take this. Until 5:30. </div>
<div>Then more.</div>
<div>Combo of: sketch designs, physical sketch, scattered notes, and portfolio oogling.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At night: browsing pretty vertical scrolly portfolio's that take user through linear narrative. And like: is this just better?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Too many design thoughts in bed </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/14</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Portfolio design continuing. </div>
<div>At the moment; no longer hating 3D diagonal card arrangement. Could be a unique site. </div>
<div>Cobalt blue font, fold out pages </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Through Brownsville </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Running to L train in Brownsville, knocking blind lady's cane. In a blur, flylo playing through, apologies sprouting </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Crown heights</div>
<div>Sharon's place - for July / $580 a month. Clean nice near museum. Wide street. Orthodox Jews </div>
<div>The word: thickly settled.</div>
<div>to the left, black people to right.</div>
<div>Dominican food in crowded mini restaurant. Asking man, 'what to order?'</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/15 and 6/16</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Morning spirit lifted a bit as design is affirmed for website. Designing about page, content, then semi working w Jekyll. </div>
<div>Nap then to </div>
<div>Mays</div>
<div>2 full express trains, missing. Noting graphic design of signs.</div>
<div>College kids in</div>
<div>A sort of half greeting from the girls. Marshall and Grif super friendly. Also incidentally tripping.</div>
<div>Milling about and wondering where to put my body.</div>
<div>Waiting waiting stalled by joints </div>
<div>Then out the door</div>
<div>Trains</div>
<div>Feeling long</div>
<div>At prospect park a beautiful beautiful day </div>
<div>Debating tripping and deciding no </div>
<div>Inside the park venue</div>
<div>Worrying about tickets then finding a place to sit, smoke. Getting instantly high (Popsicle taste intensifying as evidence) and deciding: half a tab.</div>
<div>Eventually crowd wandering, separated behind may Amanda by tall dude. Near the becky's little bro who just finished high school. </div>
<div>An opening band that the crowd liked but was somewhat irritating. French. Layers not melding. Glad I have taste still on acid.</div>
<div>Crowd paranoia. Is everyone looking at me, laughing at me? Talking about me? Knowing that can't be true but it feels like it..</div>
<div>Tame impala finally on.</div>
<div>At first currents I think.</div>
<div>Thinking: damn they got some beats. Really. And getting down.</div>
<div>Mind mischief </div>
<div>Beginning to 'confront' issues: </div>
<div>Sharing a ridiculous thought and may like shaking head. And then feeling stupid. I shouldn't feel bad. This is okay. A sort of feigned lucidity?</div>
<div>Sensitive to: may's acknowledgement of me. Things I say, how others perceive me.</div>
<div> like everyone is watching laughing talking about me. I know it's not real but seeing it happen, subtly. </div>
<div>Getting down to: why won't she talk to me? Others too. Lyrics so drawn out and just swaying singing to me.</div>
<div>Brain wandering in?</div>
<div>Weird animations</div>
<div>This beautiful beautiful young looking but I think my age girl. Face perfect.</div>
<div>Again - try to talk to may. I l think share something funny? Or trivial but like a hey here's a piece of my brain. Shot down. May looking at crooked hat. Confiscating, and not asking about anything else.</div>
<div>Hm okay.</div>
<div>How I can sort of imagine interactions w people.</div>
<div>Not really feeling warmth. From this crew. hm.</div>
<div>Maybe trip was normal? but at some point, exploring every open crevice in brain.</div>
<div>May wanting to head outside crowd. So much a part of music right now I'm not even listening to it. So yes.</div>
<div>Outside. Alternatingly sitting and standing. Enjoying music at both paces. Feeling air. And pulled in.</div>
<div>The concert actually really great. not wanting to end. Feels like we only go backwards.</div>
<div>Really sort of contemplating tame impala lyrics. Or for certain songs where mind went all over the place. Like is this song. That's amazing if it allowed my mind to wander like that..</div>
<div>But thinking</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Leaving concert to go to Hope's car. Straightedge. In a sort of wasteland in the city? Cars, only.</div>
<div>Then, in park slope. Recognizing area.</div>
<div>Figuring out trains, eventually.</div>
<div>The Q home comfortable but feeling like I'm pulling body together.</div>
<div>Listening to: now and for next few hours, camp talk.</div>
<div>Falafel guys. Egyptian guy practicing English and joking. Asking 'where you from?' To clearly white American girl.</div>
<div>Body </div>
<div>The same intense urge to pull skin out.</div>
<div>Waiting for bed.</div>
<div>W may, fidgeting so much it drives her to couch.</div>
<div>Notice this, in the morning. And feeling bad regretful my brain was fine fine should I always welcome disruption like this?</div>
<div>Clenching </div>
<div>Feeling face bone structure </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/16 morning </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A bit defeated. In a nothing can satisfy mood. Walking on street and pace is odd, noticing and zooming on people.  </div>
<div>A bit better as I write about trip</div>
<div>Wasn't like bad</div>
<div>Just mentally exhausting.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/18</div>

<hr/>
<div>5/30 - </div>
<div>getting to may’s.</div>
<div>there. a stop at duane reade -&gt; smoking. watching rick and morty. plot line getting progressively more complex, but unraveling and winding in a brilliant way. can’t remember content, just nature of progression.</div>
<div>maybe upset (just a tinge) at face that may can’t make bday? and move-in? and leaving in a bit for LA. hm. all fair choices. can’t expect her to miss an entire weekend for me..</div>
<div>sleep, early wake up.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>write to live live to write.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5/31 - </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>move in. hour journey, suitcase over turnstiles.</div>
<div>sitting on steps, seeing lena walk by, bagel in hand. carrying sunshine. chatting, unpacking.</div>
<div>a bit of work.</div>
<div>apartment dingy, dirty. room, pretty good (though a little hot). aim of summer is, mainly to work. why did i leave comfy slow boston for dirty noisy fascinating brooklyn?</div>
<div>variety coffee shop. </div>
<div>stroll &amp; home. work.</div>
<div>robin. each of us buzzing with awkward energy. things like: being reformed slacker. canadian/arab. upbringing, conservative/racist in family strain, but parents liberal. travels, traveler vs tourist. the brain. the brain. consciousness. and my neuroscience research. invitation to crazy noise rock show, missing out.</div>
<div>may over, 9 pm. cooking dinner. resources low, kitchen small. a usual ambiguous not-curry not-stir-fry deal.</div>
<div>chance echoing.</div>
<div>immersed in talk of?</div>
<div>then, walking around the neighborhood. &amp; drinks.</div>
<div>a sort of timid energy around myself, an imaginary dynamic where may is feeling responsible for introduction to hood, cheering up? something like this?</div>
<div>not standing out, or trying not to stand out. how i’m profiled.</div>
<div>thinking of myself and my brain and my scatter-brain and when i should flex my scatter-brain</div>
<div>conversation with people &amp; strangers a sort of unimaginable thing. like how it lasts long. i mean i know..but how. i should ask the penetrating questions, but they’re not too? &lt;-thought unrelated to interactions, hanging chatting with may and robin, hours each.</div>
<div>apartment smells like seto's</div>
<div>foot pain and swelling</div>
<div>brooklyn weirdly bringing out jordan</div>
<div>brutalist websites</div>
<div>saying goodbye to may - man stopping us to ask for change, and spout absolute gibberish</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/1</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>coming = good choice. shift in mental energy.</div>
<div>morning. 6 hrs not enough, but up, up anyway. forcing food down. working for like only 1-1.5 hr, and then reading and re-reading paragraph.</div>
<div>gym. richie’s gym. enter: concrete, brutal building. no doors, just stores await. posters of upcoming fights scattered, only real decor.</div>
<div>third floor labeled, in tough, thick caps font ‘third floor’. into richie’s a brooklyn bro-type and latino guy running the place. clientele: almost all hispanic and black. many buff buff dudes. weights, old, rusty. but the basics there.</div>
<div>across, elevate train tracks. level.</div>
<div>this is brooklyn, can get widdit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back home, shower, cook chicken. on chair in kitchen, laptop in front, chicken sizzling. nestled, huddled, pseudo-working.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>not 2 much success w dating apps..but like one message from sort of cute risd grad</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>out to coffee shops. first: bushwick public house. one of three clients. waiter barista person, asian, delightful, confident. talking to dutch (?) transplant. then putting on action movie, watching. next to me, black girl, short hair, typing away. and people coming and going on the way. one guy familiar w dutch man, quick conversation about football. but maybe not dutch because then waiter practicing french w him? (outside: the elevate train tracks).</div>
<div>others coming in on bikes.</div>
<div>then: dweebs. small, andro barista. clientele crazy hip, bunny shoes emblematic. looking at designy things on their laptops. words exchanged: ‘oh no, these are my headphones, i think. the cord is wrapped’. all black, flip-flop wearing woman leaving to smoke cigarette outside, after meeting with timid man who asked about my headphones. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home —&gt; working. progressively more productive.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>brooklyn as the perfect unsustainable utopia really. all people interested in creative things + others who are generally cool, want to be around coolness, and will live gritty life to be part of it. amazing .. (thought is deeper than description here)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>explosions in sky song, listening to now, culminating in crazy crazy feedback-induced high-pitched crescendo. head down, taking it in. then song stopping, at once, back to writing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>do i really want to go back to work? maybe just try to move here. why arcadia, really? but arcadia: need to keep up, send message or something.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>things to see. music. things to do. talk to people.</div>
<div>(really should write in day. or when high. but not when tired)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thought catalog project a bit more concrete. thoughts floating from central semantic nodes, but all invisible. sort of floating around. then adding filters to organize. hm. how were filters more concrete? thoughts sifted in lists, perhaps?</div>
<div>how can i make this beautiful and not just structural.</div>
<div>(get loopy and start categorizing patterns)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>when you know songs too well, the feeling today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sometimes i think ‘i’m not going to forget this i’m not i’m not’ and do.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work log:</div>
<div>css layout, all day. all day. float and clear-fix. grasping. fixing my little webpage, aligning things properly. table format, other formats. relative and absolute positioning. in the brain. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>kids don’t say to adults ‘i love adults’. we’re so reductive.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>cs examples (enter text here) as a manifestation of the conscious subconscious</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>book store - molasses</div>
<div>a sign in the restroom ‘jiggle handle if still running’. casual, real. things becoming charming when everything works too well.</div>
<div>mindfulness not needed when things are in your face.</div>
<div>a chat about - poetry book related to logic. generative poetry based on images. (the programmer artist)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home. checking - coffee shops? then, no, i can stay here. 10 minutes later, still checking coffee shops - so fuck it / leave</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>food simple. this cooked and thrown on this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>bloc, breezing through checkpoints. so far not very worthwhile.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>rest of day.</div>
<div>home and home - cooking, calling nabil.</div>
<div>nabil + marriage. how he sees it as commitment, effort, work. and that’s what he loves</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then chat w kareem.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and - again. the shoe size dilemma. just. fucking. size. up?</div>
<div>wow. a 3 hour </div>
<div>talk w kareem</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>standing may up</div>
<div>at the bar</div>
<div>turtle</div>
<div>chats</div>
<div>etc etc</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/3 (birthday :o)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>calls from: stef. quite nice. mainly talking about friends from home (nabil’s marriage). how rosie is doing, and tash. marriage, cultural expectations.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on hold w bank of america. hold hold hold, card declined earlier.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a beautiful message from harsh. unlikelihood of us meeting. then: down to earth, witty, creatively talented, and arab/american. him + others thinking i’m a great individual. wow..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a continuation of destructive indecisiveness. buying shoes (8.5), fly jordan’s from shoe store near bushwick/williamsburg. can only try one shoe at a time - with grumpy shopkeeper doling out individual shoes (people run off w shoes, crazy). feeling embarrassed, unable to make decision, until worker basically like ‘just get the 8.5 man’. the 9 bending. but 8.5 too tight on fat right foot. and then home. lesson from stan smith: just size up, and get an insole if needed really. but. wanting. shoes. now. so wearing around house. googling ‘shoe sizing’. all with awareness of how stupid this is, how i’ve done the same thing multiple times..and now, settling on most likely keeping/stretching out b/c canvas?</div>
<div>just. fucking. size. up?</div>
<div>(two-sock method, it turns, worked out, and shoes really did stretch out..hm. confusing, though feeling like less of idiot)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>indecision yielding to deep tiredness, falling asleep, exchanging small talk w robin.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>earlier: working at variety. sort of productive, though course quite dry / not practical now. and no communication from mentor.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(the day, overall, drifting by. finally, resolve to get outside (walk) and casey over just shortly after..</div>
<div>manhattan? williamsburg first. rocking new shoes, feet tight, uncomfortable (should have, should have sized up), baseball-like shirt, black fancy pants. a rather sharp look i think. drink at bourguious place. crowd older, polished. walking, wandering, then - lower east side. scanning streets, few times. </div>
<div>(patchi bailing on bar meet up)</div>
<div>guy named derrick sending us business card promising open bar in hotel. hit a few places, semi-dance/drink, then, like 1am, hotel chantelle. </div>
<div>a long line, skeptical that card will work. bouncer smiles, lets us in.</div>
<div>and derrik, in corner, pouring drinks. birthday, it turns out. 36. many other strangers there? confusing, interesting, situation overall. some swaying before making way back home.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>don’t expect don’t expect in depth calls for bday. friends mostly forgetting, that’s normal natural and i do the same. though the people who do remember, give half-hearted: yo happy bday, like maliha = hm guess we’ve drifted? a message from jade at night, saying - let’s hang out sometime this summer, no worries about drunken night. birthday feelings a recurrence, it seems.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back home ready sleep</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/4</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10:40ish shower up out to park slope - alex rapport’s. (and also, dan, evan)</div>
<div>beautiful, utopian park slope. and tasteful, young intellectual apartment. the structure: sunlight, exposed brick, fresh wooden floors, walls with pre-built character. and furnishment: red table, bright chairs. books books trinkets. should really craigslist harder, thinking..</div>
<div>hi hi to alex what have you been up to. dan in kitchen, preparing waffles. evan rising, following waffle waft shortly after.</div>
<div>diner. vitality, wakefulness w food and coffee. lena alex casey. paralegal life, while waiting for lena. last nights. a happy belated birthday - and casey’s realization that it was my birthday. then lena. gig painting for someone with parkinson’s. &amp; &amp; ..</div>
<div>back to alex’s. chatting to dan about freelance photography life, luring everyone to come to prospect park.</div>
<div>prospect park. around us, mixed crowd, older than bushwick. on blanket, semi-sunny spot, evan playing kaytranada. direct view, bikers struggling to make it up hill. beers, conversation, sun soaking. and frisbee with wesleyan 27 yr old bros.</div>
<div>retreating, sweaty.</div>
<div>a present, flowing not thinking all that much sort of state of mind.</div>
<div>recharge: shower, espresso shot</div>
<div>brooklyn museum first saturday.</div>
<div>inside, family-friendly bumpin. everyone dancing. things like: rihanna/work with heavier drums. beautiful scene, varied economic class it looks, super mixed. outside &amp; projections. writing down thoughts on gentrification - though like are these white people not gentrifiers? or is this primarily on landlord? lena’s gf, shannon, beautiful, engaging, strong eye contact, and happy birthday upon meeting. oh wow amazing hi nice to meet you. and friends: one working at warby parker, and gf who recently quit job.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>saving topics of conversation. a weird thing. do others do this? big things like love/dating</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>life here different pace here different thought pattern different..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>gentrification = the topic. problem = capitalism rewarding money, landlords charging more and more. gov should either reimburse rent differences or force rent control. cool white artsy people who can’t afford nice housing move and hip-ify area -&gt; area = cooler, others w more money attracted -&gt; rent increasing -&gt; residents leaving. needs macro level control, since the money that comes late in gentrification (primarily from businesspeople working away from area that they are gentrifying) doesn’t go directly to gov (and therefore cannot be fed into rent control). instead to companies, outside towns. and money not to local businesses, but new fresh businesses.</div>
<div>my musings, thoughts.</div>
<div>gentrification in some ways inevitable, but need to be mindful, avoid eating at the super hip, support local restaurants and run-down stores.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>post museum, staring at fountain.</div>
<div>burger. dan like - i’m really glad you’re here. caught off guard with noticement, niceness.</div>
<div>bars in crown heights. first, soul night at mostly hip clean place. music a bit too low-key, but a few jamming hard. leaving in search of more bass.</div>
<div>picking up lost ring + rewarded with instant make-out. and later, rejection.</div>
<div>dance dance</div>
<div>patchi &amp; hate for ny, long distance relationship, past few weeks in the city.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div>forgetting about life. the elements of life that constitute continuity. family.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>down about love. low tinder / bumble / real life success. hit gym hard, feel better + more secure?</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>Mentor meeting - hypothesizing rest of course</div>
<div>Daryl in the morning. Move to nyc, not getting any, weirdness of campus dance. + home. The topics. Reciprocating w/: mays visit, hanging w Christian, fling and wanting to restrict fling.</div>

<div>thank god 6/8 not 6/9 b/c then less journaling</div>
<div>heavens</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>walking may to the train station in circular route. this neighborhood. the almost orchestrated grit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the bushwhack hipsters and yearning for an earlier fictional nostalgic age</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>hm thought / background noise not seeming legitimate. journal as a source of data?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>portfolio project classifications </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the usual thought of fluid personality resonating after an article of similar opinion</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>news checks shorter in new york. music, free time, things, shorter. </div>

<div>6/9</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>refreshed &amp; born - but not sure why</div>
<div>day feeling - stifled. unsure where to work.</div>
<div>first tour at co-working spaces. one like okay but really 25/day?</div>
<div>and then air jordan 1 i couldn’t return b/c tried on too hard (really) hurting feet and feet hurt and i have made no progress in that front</div>
<div>(sat morning = shopping !) or thurs or some other day</div>
<div>but working spaces not working so nearby cafe instead, twin peaks themed. aka few twin peaks posters.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>20-25 min walk from myrtle-wychoff but people different. less grunge hipster (though present present). odd business-men or old ladies saying dear. williamsburg-looking older people. white. guy wearing raggedy clothing, talking about some sort of manual labor? portugese girl near me mixing languages elegantly. guy and woman, not dating (most likely). guy devouring devouring bagel. not just hungry or eating fast. but focused. looking at bagel. choosing the right posture/stance to maximize bite. other woman joining after. little comments made, many with bagel in mouth. focused on people </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>self-esteem maybe going up with few more tinder matches (really) &amp; realizing bumble has weird ranking system that throws people who either 1) don’t respond or 2) mass swipe (me) to bottom of pile. hmkay.</div>
<div>how to start conversations, now..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back to dweeb’s. the spot. energy level perfect. nearby, semi-flamboyant tall blonde in tank + black hair black black + denim tats u know the type talking about ‘shows’. dude organizing burlesque shows? hm. clients. dancers &amp; descriptions, amid bloc.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>continuing w/ bloc jams. jQuery refactor. useful tidbit of day: setting function as listener - w parameters - without calling function. basically .click(function() {function w params}) type of thing. seeing that foundation is helping me shortcut through some things i would have googled over and over, props will help me structure apps more quickly. trouble following directions though, program working but diverging from bloc’s. (play-pause-next functionality in bloc-jams..)</div>

<div>getting high last night helping me realize realize really where i am. like looking around brooklyn wow zah.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>—being refreshed. on that. laundry. drying cycle: disappearing into article about school segregation. ny incredibly segregated, little policy trying to fight this. but anyway. heat from drying machines. phone screen. physical sensations. but rapt in article. then home and - music. oo ah relaxing music not from cafes chosen by me. dj koze. laundry away, impromptu room reshuffling (hey this nice can work here). food. really standard mundane but needed - space - music - ability to reflect - to feel good.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5/11 (sat)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>11am up, slight hangover </div>
<div>Making toast</div>
<div>Complex toast, Sabrina calls it. Burnt (yes, intentionally) cinnamon; peanut butter, banana.</div>
<div>Sabrina up.</div>
<div>Naked and in bed. Cuddling, listening to: a fan-induced squeak. Poster rattling on walk. Sounding like: starving kitten. Sounds from street shuffling in. Hispanic music, conversation, birds. Cries. Things.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Checking time: 3:30. Oh shit. A tiger shirt (complement) &amp; preparations to leave. Breakfast at: dweebs. There the conversation like: friends smart and friends theses and some really shitty instagram experimental theses. Sabrina: rhetorical analysis of language used by peta, similarity to civil rights movement. Me: not zapping monkeys. Talking to strangers. &amp;&amp;</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Back home: finding a tootsie pop on desk. Emptied from pockets. Indicator of: memory loss. Or nature of it. Because when sober, you expect to forget many trivial things (when you went to bathroom for ex) - but not forget how tootsie pop was lost. What's feeding perception of memory </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/12</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Morning hi robin and friends then gym</div>
<div>Working at kave. Coffee shop nestled in small hip complex. </div>
<div>Delving into 1 hour convo with two native Manhattan parents. Prompted by: 'you, what do you do for a living?'. As in, why are you working at this coffee shop?  Explaining explaining listening. Women: makes puppets now. Used to be audio engineer for brain eno. Worked at bank, did other things. Now tho, puppets and newspaper clippings. Husband, fitness trainer (shows). (Recalling a women's envy: 'you just do what you want')</div>
<div>Yay conversations with strangers</div>
<div>Like I'm opening up </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Stopping by robin's bike shop. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Boiler room. Well shmancy dinner w may, Greenpoint. Looking like Park Slope.</div>
<div>Following experimental edm bro, guy with turntable tatted playing abrasive beats. Getting places with experiment tho, and eventually bringing on flamboyant passionate rapper. </div>
<div>Show begins.</div>
<div>Dance 4 hours</div>
<div>Hi Ryan Glassman</div>
<div>Hi Emma's friends</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/13 </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Portfolio design.</div>
<div>Meeting may at dweeb's and ah I can't take this. Until 5:30. </div>
<div>Then more.</div>
<div>Combo of: sketch designs, physical sketch, scattered notes, and portfolio oogling.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At night: browsing pretty vertical scrolly portfolio's that take user through linear narrative. And like: is this just better?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Too many design thoughts in bed </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/14</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Portfolio design continuing. </div>
<div>At the moment; no longer hating 3D diagonal card arrangement. Could be a unique site. </div>
<div>Cobalt blue font, fold out pages </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Through Brownsville </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Running to L train in Brownsville, knocking blind lady's cane. In a blur, flylo playing through, apologies sprouting </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Crown heights</div>
<div>Sharon's place - for July / $580 a month. Clean nice near museum. Wide street. Orthodox Jews </div>
<div>The word: thickly settled.</div>
<div>to the left, black people to right.</div>
<div>Dominican food in crowded mini restaurant. Asking man, 'what to order?'</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/15 and 6/16</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Morning spirit lifted a bit as design is affirmed for website. Designing about page, content, then semi working w Jekyll. </div>
<div>Nap then to </div>
<div>Mays</div>
<div>2 full express trains, missing. Noting graphic design of signs.</div>
<div>College kids in</div>
<div>A sort of half greeting from the girls. Marshall and Grif super friendly. Also incidentally tripping.</div>
<div>Milling about and wondering where to put my body.</div>
<div>Waiting waiting stalled by joints </div>
<div>Then out the door</div>
<div>Trains</div>
<div>Feeling long</div>
<div>At prospect park a beautiful beautiful day </div>
<div>Debating tripping and deciding no </div>
<div>Inside the park venue</div>
<div>Worrying about tickets then finding a place to sit, smoke. Getting instantly high (Popsicle taste intensifying as evidence) and deciding: half a tab.</div>
<div>Eventually crowd wandering, separated behind may Amanda by tall dude. Near the becky's little bro who just finished high school. </div>
<div>An opening band that the crowd liked but was somewhat irritating. French. Layers not melding. Glad I have taste still on acid.</div>
<div>Crowd paranoia. Is everyone looking at me, laughing at me? Talking about me? Knowing that can't be true but it feels like it..</div>
<div>Tame impala finally on.</div>
<div>At first currents I think.</div>
<div>Thinking: damn they got some beats. Really. And getting down.</div>
<div>Mind mischief </div>
<div>Beginning to 'confront' issues: </div>
<div>Sharing a ridiculous thought and may like shaking head. And then feeling stupid. I shouldn't feel bad. This is okay. A sort of feigned lucidity?</div>
<div>Sensitive to: may's acknowledgement of me. Things I say, how others perceive me.</div>
<div> like everyone is watching laughing talking about me. I know it's not real but seeing it happen, subtly. </div>
<div>Getting down to: why won't she talk to me? Others too. Lyrics so drawn out and just swaying singing to me.</div>
<div>Brain wandering in?</div>
<div>Weird animations</div>
<div>This beautiful beautiful young looking but I think my age girl. Face perfect.</div>
<div>Again - try to talk to may. I l think share something funny? Or trivial but like a hey here's a piece of my brain. Shot down. May looking at crooked hat. Confiscating, and not asking about anything else.</div>
<div>Hm okay.</div>
<div>How I can sort of imagine interactions w people.</div>
<div>Not really feeling warmth. From this crew. hm.</div>
<div>Maybe trip was normal? but at some point, exploring every open crevice in brain.</div>
<div>May wanting to head outside crowd. So much a part of music right now I'm not even listening to it. So yes.</div>
<div>Outside. Alternatingly sitting and standing. Enjoying music at both paces. Feeling air. And pulled in.</div>
<div>The concert actually really great. not wanting to end. Feels like we only go backwards.</div>
<div>Really sort of contemplating tame impala lyrics. Or for certain songs where mind went all over the place. Like is this song. That's amazing if it allowed my mind to wander like that..</div>
<div>But thinking</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Leaving concert to go to Hope's car. Straightedge. In a sort of wasteland in the city? Cars, only.</div>
<div>Then, in park slope. Recognizing area.</div>
<div>Figuring out trains, eventually.</div>
<div>The Q home comfortable but feeling like I'm pulling body together.</div>
<div>Listening to: now and for next few hours, camp talk.</div>
<div>Falafel guys. Egyptian guy practicing English and joking. Asking 'where you from?' To clearly white American girl.</div>
<div>Body </div>
<div>The same intense urge to pull skin out.</div>
<div>Waiting for bed.</div>
<div>W may, fidgeting so much it drives her to couch.</div>
<div>Notice this, in the morning. And feeling bad regretful my brain was fine fine should I always welcome disruption like this?</div>
<div>Clenching </div>
<div>Feeling face bone structure </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/16 morning </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A bit defeated. In a nothing can satisfy mood. Walking on street and pace is odd, noticing and zooming on people.  </div>
<div>A bit better as I write about trip</div>
<div>Wasn't like bad</div>
<div>Just mentally exhausting.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/18</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today like</div>
<div>revisiting post acid weirdness</div>
<div>and reading journal</div>
<div>and just hming more</div>
<div>at maria hernandez park</div>
<div>wondering if i can play ball</div>
<div>decide: best not to play if i need to pee and there is no bathroom and i may have to leave for a bathroom</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and thinking: i have nothing to write about what am i?</div>
<div>but no - have things to write about</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>smoking with robin and talking bike shop. and vancouver.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>compulsive phone checking</div>

<div>responsive design and grid contemplations</div>
<div>css</div>
<div>html</div>
<div>in my head</div>
<div>coding do i like it okay i like it the front-end stuff at least.</div>
<div>what am i doing again? data science? maybe just designer coder. do i need data too? yea i suppose, full satisfaction</div>
<div>work for data viz agency = the dream</div>
<div>saying the obvious</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>waiting for may</div>
<div>getting into bk ~12:30 doing it late nye style</div>
<div>realizing: not that much time chilling with may in ny.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today: a bit lonely/confining. hence walk. but productive with jekyll/html -&gt; js migration of layout generation. from the csv u know.</div>
<div>can grid layout have separate media queries?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>post acid ~~~weirdness.</div>
<div>was this a bad trip?</div>
<div>don’t think so</div>
<div>just overwhelming but sort of good at tame impala</div>
<div>and just restless and sort of not good after</div>
<div>and morning after</div>
<div>blerghling all over the place</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ideas for interactive code writing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>brain all over the place but in productive direction.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the smell in new dorm</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>When u set your own precedent </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Leaving an unnamed tension open in your brain</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6.21</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Working on interaction all day</div>
<div>Brain feeling hazy</div>
<div>Nap, second awakening, finally interaction detected </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Apartment emptied</div>
<div>Conversation about baseball nearby </div>
<div>At patchi's bday</div>
<div>Talking mostly to Eliza</div>
<div>About intelligence, bridgewater, yearly review, emotional fluctuation &amp; it's causes / overlaying optimism and driving to towards good or away from bad. Siavash. Whispering dome.</div>
<div>Sami's cousin cute art therapist</div>
<div>Being in the city &amp; ceasing to exist </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/24</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>things that have happened lately-</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>fasting, just one day tried. cloudiness outside contributing perhaps, but tired, irritable. coffee please? </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking of tinder tag. now ‘okay with confusion’. starting with quirks, values, and sorting of getting somewhere, but nothing catchy, funny, compelling. thinking of juxtaposing ‘an alternate life (weird silly dream of self’ with ‘current life (what i like to do)’. alternate life: object? owl? i don’t know. lego man? cartoon character. some sort of inanimate object.</div>
<div>swiping like it’s a chore - need grlz</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>co-working space. quiet mostly productive sometimes insular. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>smoking w robin. going off on tangents about web development. creating things with pure logic, obsessiveness.</div>
<div>web dev: creating things with pure logic, obsessiveness. love/hate, but mostly mostly good for me and suited to my brain.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>post bridgewater: thinking about brain tendencies and - would love to more concretely know what they are. previously: contradicted with idea of fluid self + could not take criticism, or realize limits. but now, ready, would like to figure out career + path.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>talking to ~me too much lately. sometimes catching self breaking out into small gestures.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>podcasts. most recently: american life about being fat. sam harris (eliza’s recommendation) on drugs as potential tool for mindfulness. specifically: show that altered conscious is possible can motivate meditation? okay sure, me a skeptic but not in that regard. invisibilia about: social norms. mcdonald’s in russia + american fake smiles (expectation for happiness in service industry). 99% invisible - sweden switching from right to left side of driving (beautiful).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in the news: brexit, really?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at night - trouble sleeping because thinking about code. always the potential thought of: okay - what do i do next. how can i structure the next piece?</div>
<div>do i like coding? (me think so)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>headspace liike</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>website in the website living in the website. interactivity mainly working - time-grid filter etc etc. need to just re-structure css.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/26 (weekend)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>laptop near me, saying ‘I SUPPORT THE WAR ON AMERICA BY BATH SALTS'</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>haircut. strolling the neighborhood, options surprisingly narrow.</div>
<div>sitting, unacknowledged in barbershop w/ just one barber. 3 customers. taking time. so bouncing and.</div>
<div>similar deal - one barber, but one customer. </div>
<div>my turn. no acknowledgement after telling him how i would like hair. i like the length on top, i say. most of the haircut sideways. 30 min later, hair gone. a strange symmetrical cut with a little side swipe. accentuating long face. a confined frustration. hats.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>better description - haircut, confined frustration, hats </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>saturday morning shopping in manhattan. nike store first. a spectacle. walking away with size 9 huaraches, conflicted with that and size up - though both really too narrow for feet. option to return. shoes fly as hell, lamenting the ongoing quest to continue to find comfy dope shoes. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>new york attention span lower than in boston. not listening to full songs or albums. shuffling, flipping through. or, step back, not just sitting on subway. compelled to get: extra stimulation of music, even through headphones (w/ layers n layers filtered out).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>balling in the neighborhood (5 min into run, enticed by ball)</div>
<div>then: long chat with michael. about: leaving job / what i’ve been up to / solidified ambitions. brooklyn &amp; what’s like. travel plans. trip to saudi, door’s engagement. mike’s relationship (good, though less time w friends), mental health, plans to do molly. making dinner, eating, and conversation transitioning from agenda to just - chilling. talking about little things and observations. nice and a little heartwarming.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>not going out. coding a little. reading a little? &amp; sleep, 12:30. okay with it, mostly. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>about page -</div>
<div>interested in data as pursuit of truth</div>
<div>code as a way to create with logic</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sat night out. walking 1 hr - design podcast baba linked to as company. interesting actually. designing meaningful interactions, system that holds designers more accountable (sort of like in healthcare). then kelela &amp; friends.</div>
<div>at shannon’s. hi. a mostly harmless looking group. names. the game where you put phone on forehead, describe. </div>
<div>rooftop.</div>
<div>en route - talking to unc senior, aspiring musician. about his process. my dabbling.</div>
<div>‘so brooklyn’. flamboyant gay man in all white (later, pants replaced w cutoff shorts), red high heels. dancing grinding a live Facebook selfie feed. poetry, dry &amp; sometimes funny. poetry, harrowing &amp; racial. comedy - mostly stereotypical. music, folky. dance. mostly confusing. (conversation about making sense of dance afterwards..)</div>
<div>talking to - music guy from brown (name?). 2013 grad, director of music curation at a studio. an attitude of networking, confidence that bleeds into life. walking off with him + dancer to get whiskey. </div>
<div>passing bottle around</div>
<div>talking to - girl who has dance company, works for theater company &amp; does something else? wow. in dc previously. stretching convo out with her and music guy nearby</div>
<div>lover’s and friends, yet again. danz for hour, me and group of mostly girls.</div>
<div>bye, 1:20am. shannon, lena telling me i’m a good dancer? lol.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>podcasts about - myth of personality (invisibilia - reformed prisoner example). my conclusion that personality is response to change in emotional stimuli. or in some ways energy. it’s not your state but the forces that propel you to respond to a new stimulus differently. this needs more thinking.. </div>
<div>and taste (538). algorithms as a means of eliminating human bias. arbitrariness of likes and dislikes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>recurring live dream of like leaving arcadia or them not wanting me and resolving to carve my own path. should get this negativity out before returning to job.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>

<div>5/30 - </div>
<div>getting to may’s.</div>
<div>there. a stop at duane reade -&gt; smoking. watching rick and morty. plot line getting progressively more complex, but unraveling and winding in a brilliant way. can’t remember content, just nature of progression.</div>
<div>maybe upset (just a tinge) at face that may can’t make bday? and move-in? and leaving in a bit for LA. hm. all fair choices. can’t expect her to miss an entire weekend for me..</div>
<div>sleep, early wake up.</div>

<div>sitting on steps, seeing lena walk by, bagel in hand. carrying sunshine. chatting, unpacking.</div>
<div>a bit of work.</div>
<div>apartment dingy, dirty. room, pretty good (though a little hot). aim of summer is, mainly to work. why did i leave comfy slow boston for dirty noisy fascinating brooklyn?</div>
<div>variety coffee shop. </div>
<div>stroll &amp; home. work.</div>
<div>robin. each of us buzzing with awkward energy. things like: being reformed slacker. canadian/arab. upbringing, conservative/racist in family strain, but parents liberal. travels, traveler vs tourist. the brain. the brain. consciousness. and my neuroscience research. invitation to crazy noise rock show, missing out.</div>
<div>may over, 9 pm. cooking dinner. resources low, kitchen small. a usual ambiguous not-curry not-stir-fry deal.</div>
<div>chance echoing.</div>
<div>immersed in talk of?</div>
<div>then, walking around the neighborhood. &amp; drinks.</div>
<div>a sort of timid energy around myself, an imaginary dynamic where may is feeling responsible for introduction to hood, cheering up? something like this?</div>
<div>not standing out, or trying not to stand out. how i’m profiled.</div>
<div>thinking of myself and my brain and my scatter-brain and when i should flex my scatter-brain</div>
<div>conversation with people &amp; strangers a sort of unimaginable thing. like how it lasts long. i mean i know..but how. i should ask the penetrating questions, but they’re not too? &lt;-thought unrelated to interactions, hanging chatting with may and robin, hours each.</div>
<div>apartment smells like seto's</div>
<div>foot pain and swelling</div>
<div>brooklyn weirdly bringing out jordan</div>
<div>brutalist websites</div>
<div>saying goodbye to may - man stopping us to ask for change, and spout absolute gibberish</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/1</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>coming = good choice. shift in mental energy.</div>
<div>morning. 6 hrs not enough, but up, up anyway. forcing food down. working for like only 1-1.5 hr, and then reading and re-reading paragraph.</div>
<div>gym. richie’s gym. enter: concrete, brutal building. no doors, just stores await. posters of upcoming fights scattered, only real decor.</div>
<div>third floor labeled, in tough, thick caps font ‘third floor’. into richie’s a brooklyn bro-type and latino guy running the place. clientele: almost all hispanic and black. many buff buff dudes. weights, old, rusty. but the basics there.</div>
<div>across, elevate train tracks. level.</div>
<div>this is brooklyn, can get widdit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back home, shower, cook chicken. on chair in kitchen, laptop in front, chicken sizzling. nestled, huddled, pseudo-working.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>not 2 much success w dating apps..but like one message from sort of cute risd grad</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>out to coffee shops. first: bushwick public house. one of three clients. waiter barista person, asian, delightful, confident. talking to dutch (?) transplant. then putting on action movie, watching. next to me, black girl, short hair, typing away. and people coming and going on the way. one guy familiar w dutch man, quick conversation about football. but maybe not dutch because then waiter practicing french w him? (outside: the elevate train tracks).</div>
<div>others coming in on bikes.</div>
<div>then: dweebs. small, andro barista. clientele crazy hip, bunny shoes emblematic. looking at designy things on their laptops. words exchanged: ‘oh no, these are my headphones, i think. the cord is wrapped’. all black, flip-flop wearing woman leaving to smoke cigarette outside, after meeting with timid man who asked about my headphones. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home —&gt; working. progressively more productive.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>brooklyn as the perfect unsustainable utopia really. all people interested in creative things + others who are generally cool, want to be around coolness, and will live gritty life to be part of it. amazing .. (thought is deeper than description here)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>explosions in sky song, listening to now, culminating in crazy crazy feedback-induced high-pitched crescendo. head down, taking it in. then song stopping, at once, back to writing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>do i really want to go back to work? maybe just try to move here. why arcadia, really? but arcadia: need to keep up, send message or something.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>things to see. music. things to do. talk to people.</div>
<div>(really should write in day. or when high. but not when tired)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thought catalog project a bit more concrete. thoughts floating from central semantic nodes, but all invisible. sort of floating around. then adding filters to organize. hm. how were filters more concrete? thoughts sifted in lists, perhaps?</div>
<div>how can i make this beautiful and not just structural.</div>
<div>(get loopy and start categorizing patterns)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>when you know songs too well, the feeling today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sometimes i think ‘i’m not going to forget this i’m not i’m not’ and do.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work log:</div>
<div>css layout, all day. all day. float and clear-fix. grasping. fixing my little webpage, aligning things properly. table format, other formats. relative and absolute positioning. in the brain. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>kids don’t say to adults ‘i love adults’. we’re so reductive.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>cs examples (enter text here) as a manifestation of the conscious subconscious</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>book store - molasses</div>
<div>a sign in the restroom ‘jiggle handle if still running’. casual, real. things becoming charming when everything works too well.</div>
<div>mindfulness not needed when things are in your face.</div>
<div>a chat about - poetry book related to logic. generative poetry based on images. (the programmer artist)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home. checking - coffee shops? then, no, i can stay here. 10 minutes later, still checking coffee shops - so fuck it / leave</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>food simple. this cooked and thrown on this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>bloc, breezing through checkpoints. so far not very worthwhile.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>rest of day.</div>
<div>home and home - cooking, calling nabil.</div>
<div>nabil + marriage. how he sees it as commitment, effort, work. and that’s what he loves</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then chat w kareem.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and - again. the shoe size dilemma. just. fucking. size. up?</div>
<div>wow. a 3 hour </div>
<div>talk w kareem</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>standing may up</div>
<div>at the bar</div>
<div>turtle</div>
<div>chats</div>
<div>etc etc</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/3 (birthday :o)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>calls from: stef. quite nice. mainly talking about friends from home (nabil’s marriage). how rosie is doing, and tash. marriage, cultural expectations.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on hold w bank of america. hold hold hold, card declined earlier.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a beautiful message from harsh. unlikelihood of us meeting. then: down to earth, witty, creatively talented, and arab/american. him + others thinking i’m a great individual. wow..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a continuation of destructive indecisiveness. buying shoes (8.5), fly jordan’s from shoe store near bushwick/williamsburg. can only try one shoe at a time - with grumpy shopkeeper doling out individual shoes (people run off w shoes, crazy). feeling embarrassed, unable to make decision, until worker basically like ‘just get the 8.5 man’. the 9 bending. but 8.5 too tight on fat right foot. and then home. lesson from stan smith: just size up, and get an insole if needed really. but. wanting. shoes. now. so wearing around house. googling ‘shoe sizing’. all with awareness of how stupid this is, how i’ve done the same thing multiple times..and now, settling on most likely keeping/stretching out b/c canvas?</div>
<div>just. fucking. size. up?</div>
<div>(two-sock method, it turns, worked out, and shoes really did stretch out..hm. confusing, though feeling like less of idiot)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>indecision yielding to deep tiredness, falling asleep, exchanging small talk w robin.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>earlier: working at variety. sort of productive, though course quite dry / not practical now. and no communication from mentor.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(the day, overall, drifting by. finally, resolve to get outside (walk) and casey over just shortly after..</div>
<div>manhattan? williamsburg first. rocking new shoes, feet tight, uncomfortable (should have, should have sized up), baseball-like shirt, black fancy pants. a rather sharp look i think. drink at bourguious place. crowd older, polished. walking, wandering, then - lower east side. scanning streets, few times. </div>
<div>(patchi bailing on bar meet up)</div>
<div>guy named derrick sending us business card promising open bar in hotel. hit a few places, semi-dance/drink, then, like 1am, hotel chantelle. </div>
<div>a long line, skeptical that card will work. bouncer smiles, lets us in.</div>
<div>and derrik, in corner, pouring drinks. birthday, it turns out. 36. many other strangers there? confusing, interesting, situation overall. some swaying before making way back home.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>don’t expect don’t expect in depth calls for bday. friends mostly forgetting, that’s normal natural and i do the same. though the people who do remember, give half-hearted: yo happy bday, like maliha = hm guess we’ve drifted? a message from jade at night, saying - let’s hang out sometime this summer, no worries about drunken night. birthday feelings a recurrence, it seems.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back home ready sleep</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/4</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10:40ish shower up out to park slope - alex rapport’s. (and also, dan, evan)</div>
<div>beautiful, utopian park slope. and tasteful, young intellectual apartment. the structure: sunlight, exposed brick, fresh wooden floors, walls with pre-built character. and furnishment: red table, bright chairs. books books trinkets. should really craigslist harder, thinking..</div>
<div>hi hi to alex what have you been up to. dan in kitchen, preparing waffles. evan rising, following waffle waft shortly after.</div>
<div>diner. vitality, wakefulness w food and coffee. lena alex casey. paralegal life, while waiting for lena. last nights. a happy belated birthday - and casey’s realization that it was my birthday. then lena. gig painting for someone with parkinson’s. &amp; &amp; ..</div>
<div>back to alex’s. chatting to dan about freelance photography life, luring everyone to come to prospect park.</div>
<div>prospect park. around us, mixed crowd, older than bushwick. on blanket, semi-sunny spot, evan playing kaytranada. direct view, bikers struggling to make it up hill. beers, conversation, sun soaking. and frisbee with wesleyan 27 yr old bros.</div>
<div>retreating, sweaty.</div>
<div>a present, flowing not thinking all that much sort of state of mind.</div>
<div>recharge: shower, espresso shot</div>
<div>brooklyn museum first saturday.</div>
<div>inside, family-friendly bumpin. everyone dancing. things like: rihanna/work with heavier drums. beautiful scene, varied economic class it looks, super mixed. outside &amp; projections. writing down thoughts on gentrification - though like are these white people not gentrifiers? or is this primarily on landlord? lena’s gf, shannon, beautiful, engaging, strong eye contact, and happy birthday upon meeting. oh wow amazing hi nice to meet you. and friends: one working at warby parker, and gf who recently quit job.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>saving topics of conversation. a weird thing. do others do this? big things like love/dating</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>life here different pace here different thought pattern different..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>gentrification = the topic. problem = capitalism rewarding money, landlords charging more and more. gov should either reimburse rent differences or force rent control. cool white artsy people who can’t afford nice housing move and hip-ify area -&gt; area = cooler, others w more money attracted -&gt; rent increasing -&gt; residents leaving. needs macro level control, since the money that comes late in gentrification (primarily from businesspeople working away from area that they are gentrifying) doesn’t go directly to gov (and therefore cannot be fed into rent control). instead to companies, outside towns. and money not to local businesses, but new fresh businesses.</div>
<div>my musings, thoughts.</div>
<div>gentrification in some ways inevitable, but need to be mindful, avoid eating at the super hip, support local restaurants and run-down stores.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>post museum, staring at fountain.</div>
<div>burger. dan like - i’m really glad you’re here. caught off guard with noticement, niceness.</div>
<div>bars in crown heights. first, soul night at mostly hip clean place. music a bit too low-key, but a few jamming hard. leaving in search of more bass.</div>
<div>picking up lost ring + rewarded with instant make-out. and later, rejection.</div>
<div>dance dance</div>
<div>patchi &amp; hate for ny, long distance relationship, past few weeks in the city.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>franklin park, the bar. a sort of truce ground. gentrifiers, local community there. an even within locals: spectrum. some people </div>
<div>one orthodox jew, and, anna zeidman’s bumble date, walking in with infinite jest in hand.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/5</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>james blake / music to awaken, ground me. not much time to listen to music lately.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>when the environment is the focus:</div>
<div>reflection, set behind, can’t keep up w present</div>
<div>forgetting about life. the elements of life that constitute continuity. family.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>down about love. low tinder / bumble / real life success. hit gym hard, feel better + more secure?</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div>Going down better than expectation, though lingering suspicion and disappointment, maybe</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mentor meeting - hypothesizing rest of course</div>
<div>Daryl in the morning. Move to nyc, not getting any, weirdness of campus dance. + home. The topics. Reciprocating w/: mays visit, hanging w Christian, fling and wanting to restrict fling.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Dweeb's. Stirred by espresso smell.</div>
<div>Coursewise: DOM animation. Wee rotating text.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Junglepussy - bklyn feminist </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Things: distraction, again by shoes and shoe sizes, chats w robin, Ana, now trip to mays</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Learning today: Dom interaction and animation, more in depth selectors</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Ny further scattering brain</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Sick of hipsters. </div>
<div>The new bushwick - a 5 min walk and: white people.</div>

<div>6/8</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>High and thoughts racing </div>
<div>Racing </div>
<div>Excited about things in making </div>
<div>Trumpets in rap nostalgia </div>
<div>May by my side </div>
<div>Stepping back </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thank god 6/8 not 6/9 b/c then less journaling</div>
<div>heavens</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>walking may to the train station in circular route. this neighborhood. the almost orchestrated grit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the bushwhack hipsters and yearning for an earlier fictional nostalgic age</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>smoking robin’s ‘awake’ weed</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>loving casey’s bro’s website. blue popping font and beautiful typeface type shit</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>them too big air jordan 1’s can’t return humiliation </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hm thought / background noise not seeming legitimate. journal as a source of data?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>portfolio project classifications </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the usual thought of fluid personality resonating after an article of similar opinion</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>news checks shorter in new york. music, free time, things, shorter. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>too busy to talk to myself</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/9</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>refreshed &amp; born - but not sure why</div>
<div>day feeling - stifled. unsure where to work.</div>
<div>first tour at co-working spaces. one like okay but really 25/day?</div>
<div>and then air jordan 1 i couldn’t return b/c tried on too hard (really) hurting feet and feet hurt and i have made no progress in that front</div>
<div>(sat morning = shopping !) or thurs or some other day</div>
<div>but working spaces not working so nearby cafe instead, twin peaks themed. aka few twin peaks posters.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>20-25 min walk from myrtle-wychoff but people different. less grunge hipster (though present present). odd business-men or old ladies saying dear. williamsburg-looking older people. white. guy wearing raggedy clothing, talking about some sort of manual labor? portugese girl near me mixing languages elegantly. guy and woman, not dating (most likely). guy devouring devouring bagel. not just hungry or eating fast. but focused. looking at bagel. choosing the right posture/stance to maximize bite. other woman joining after. little comments made, many with bagel in mouth. focused on people </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>self-esteem maybe going up with few more tinder matches (really) &amp; realizing bumble has weird ranking system that throws people who either 1) don’t respond or 2) mass swipe (me) to bottom of pile. hmkay.</div>
<div>how to start conversations, now..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back to dweeb’s. the spot. energy level perfect. nearby, semi-flamboyant tall blonde in tank + black hair black black + denim tats u know the type talking about ‘shows’. dude organizing burlesque shows? hm. clients. dancers &amp; descriptions, amid bloc.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>continuing w/ bloc jams. jQuery refactor. useful tidbit of day: setting function as listener - w parameters - without calling function. basically .click(function() {function w params}) type of thing. seeing that foundation is helping me shortcut through some things i would have googled over and over, props will help me structure apps more quickly. trouble following directions though, program working but diverging from bloc’s. (play-pause-next functionality in bloc-jams..)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>music cafe hipster grunge 2 much in head</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home. laundry. mexican music blasting (blasting everywhere really..whizzing through my head, further disorienting).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>getting high last night helping me realize realize really where i am. like looking around brooklyn wow zah.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>—being refreshed. on that. laundry. drying cycle: disappearing into article about school segregation. ny incredibly segregated, little policy trying to fight this. but anyway. heat from drying machines. phone screen. physical sensations. but rapt in article. then home and - music. oo ah relaxing music not from cafes chosen by me. dj koze. laundry away, impromptu room reshuffling (hey this nice can work here). food. really standard mundane but needed - space - music - ability to reflect - to feel good.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5/11 (sat)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>11am up, slight hangover </div>
<div>Making toast</div>
<div>Complex toast, Sabrina calls it. Burnt (yes, intentionally) cinnamon; peanut butter, banana.</div>
<div>Sabrina up.</div>
<div>Naked and in bed. Cuddling, listening to: a fan-induced squeak. Poster rattling on walk. Sounding like: starving kitten. Sounds from street shuffling in. Hispanic music, conversation, birds. Cries. Things.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Checking time: 3:30. Oh shit. A tiger shirt (complement) &amp; preparations to leave. Breakfast at: dweebs. There the conversation like: friends smart and friends theses and some really shitty instagram experimental theses. Sabrina: rhetorical analysis of language used by peta, similarity to civil rights movement. Me: not zapping monkeys. Talking to strangers. &amp;&amp;</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Back home: finding a tootsie pop on desk. Emptied from pockets. Indicator of: memory loss. Or nature of it. Because when sober, you expect to forget many trivial things (when you went to bathroom for ex) - but not forget how tootsie pop was lost. What's feeding perception of memory </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/12</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Morning hi robin and friends then gym</div>
<div>Working at kave. Coffee shop nestled in small hip complex. </div>
<div>Delving into 1 hour convo with two native Manhattan parents. Prompted by: 'you, what do you do for a living?'. As in, why are you working at this coffee shop?  Explaining explaining listening. Women: makes puppets now. Used to be audio engineer for brain eno. Worked at bank, did other things. Now tho, puppets and newspaper clippings. Husband, fitness trainer (shows). (Recalling a women's envy: 'you just do what you want')</div>
<div>Yay conversations with strangers</div>
<div>Like I'm opening up </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Stopping by robin's bike shop. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Boiler room. Well shmancy dinner w may, Greenpoint. Looking like Park Slope.</div>
<div>Following experimental edm bro, guy with turntable tatted playing abrasive beats. Getting places with experiment tho, and eventually bringing on flamboyant passionate rapper. </div>
<div>Show begins.</div>
<div>Dance 4 hours</div>
<div>Hi Ryan Glassman</div>
<div>Hi Emma's friends</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/13 </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Portfolio design.</div>
<div>Meeting may at dweeb's and ah I can't take this. Until 5:30. </div>
<div>Then more.</div>
<div>Combo of: sketch designs, physical sketch, scattered notes, and portfolio oogling.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At night: browsing pretty vertical scrolly portfolio's that take user through linear narrative. And like: is this just better?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Too many design thoughts in bed </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/14</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Portfolio design continuing. </div>
<div>At the moment; no longer hating 3D diagonal card arrangement. Could be a unique site. </div>
<div>Cobalt blue font, fold out pages </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Through Brownsville </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Running to L train in Brownsville, knocking blind lady's cane. In a blur, flylo playing through, apologies sprouting </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Crown heights</div>
<div>Sharon's place - for July / $580 a month. Clean nice near museum. Wide street. Orthodox Jews </div>
<div>The word: thickly settled.</div>
<div>to the left, black people to right.</div>
<div>Dominican food in crowded mini restaurant. Asking man, 'what to order?'</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/15 and 6/16</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Morning spirit lifted a bit as design is affirmed for website. Designing about page, content, then semi working w Jekyll. </div>
<div>Nap then to </div>
<div>Mays</div>
<div>2 full express trains, missing. Noting graphic design of signs.</div>
<div>College kids in</div>
<div>A sort of half greeting from the girls. Marshall and Grif super friendly. Also incidentally tripping.</div>
<div>Milling about and wondering where to put my body.</div>
<div>Waiting waiting stalled by joints </div>
<div>Then out the door</div>
<div>Trains</div>
<div>Feeling long</div>
<div>At prospect park a beautiful beautiful day </div>
<div>Debating tripping and deciding no </div>
<div>Inside the park venue</div>
<div>Worrying about tickets then finding a place to sit, smoke. Getting instantly high (Popsicle taste intensifying as evidence) and deciding: half a tab.</div>
<div>Eventually crowd wandering, separated behind may Amanda by tall dude. Near the becky's little bro who just finished high school. </div>
<div>An opening band that the crowd liked but was somewhat irritating. French. Layers not melding. Glad I have taste still on acid.</div>
<div>Crowd paranoia. Is everyone looking at me, laughing at me? Talking about me? Knowing that can't be true but it feels like it..</div>
<div>Tame impala finally on.</div>
<div>At first currents I think.</div>
<div>Thinking: damn they got some beats. Really. And getting down.</div>
<div>Mind mischief </div>
<div>Beginning to 'confront' issues: </div>
<div>Sharing a ridiculous thought and may like shaking head. And then feeling stupid. I shouldn't feel bad. This is okay. A sort of feigned lucidity?</div>
<div>Sensitive to: may's acknowledgement of me. Things I say, how others perceive me.</div>
<div> like everyone is watching laughing talking about me. I know it's not real but seeing it happen, subtly. </div>
<div>Getting down to: why won't she talk to me? Others too. Lyrics so drawn out and just swaying singing to me.</div>
<div>Brain wandering in?</div>
<div>Weird animations</div>
<div>This beautiful beautiful young looking but I think my age girl. Face perfect.</div>
<div>Again - try to talk to may. I l think share something funny? Or trivial but like a hey here's a piece of my brain. Shot down. May looking at crooked hat. Confiscating, and not asking about anything else.</div>
<div>Hm okay.</div>
<div>How I can sort of imagine interactions w people.</div>
<div>Not really feeling warmth. From this crew. hm.</div>
<div>Maybe trip was normal? but at some point, exploring every open crevice in brain.</div>
<div>May wanting to head outside crowd. So much a part of music right now I'm not even listening to it. So yes.</div>
<div>Outside. Alternatingly sitting and standing. Enjoying music at both paces. Feeling air. And pulled in.</div>
<div>The concert actually really great. not wanting to end. Feels like we only go backwards.</div>
<div>Really sort of contemplating tame impala lyrics. Or for certain songs where mind went all over the place. Like is this song. That's amazing if it allowed my mind to wander like that..</div>
<div>But thinking</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Leaving concert to go to Hope's car. Straightedge. In a sort of wasteland in the city? Cars, only.</div>
<div>Then, in park slope. Recognizing area.</div>
<div>Figuring out trains, eventually.</div>
<div>The Q home comfortable but feeling like I'm pulling body together.</div>
<div>Listening to: now and for next few hours, camp talk.</div>
<div>Falafel guys. Egyptian guy practicing English and joking. Asking 'where you from?' To clearly white American girl.</div>
<div>Body </div>
<div>The same intense urge to pull skin out.</div>
<div>Waiting for bed.</div>
<div>W may, fidgeting so much it drives her to couch.</div>
<div>Notice this, in the morning. And feeling bad regretful my brain was fine fine should I always welcome disruption like this?</div>
<div>Clenching </div>
<div>Feeling face bone structure </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/16 morning </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A bit defeated. In a nothing can satisfy mood. Walking on street and pace is odd, noticing and zooming on people.  </div>
<div>A bit better as I write about trip</div>
<div>Wasn't like bad</div>
<div>Just mentally exhausting.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/18</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div>work for data viz agency = the dream</div>
<div>saying the obvious</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>waiting for may</div>
<div>getting into bk ~12:30 doing it late nye style</div>
<div>realizing: not that much time chilling with may in ny.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today: a bit lonely/confining. hence walk. but productive with jekyll/html -&gt; js migration of layout generation. from the csv u know.</div>
<div>can grid layout have separate media queries?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>post acid ~~~weirdness.</div>
<div>was this a bad trip?</div>
<div>don’t think so</div>
<div>just overwhelming but sort of good at tame impala</div>
<div>and just restless and sort of not good after</div>
<div>and morning after</div>
<div>blerghling all over the place</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ideas for interactive code writing.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div>6.21</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Working on interaction all day</div>
<div>Brain feeling hazy</div>
<div>Nap, second awakening, finally interaction detected </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Apartment emptied</div>
<div>Conversation about baseball nearby </div>
<div>At patchi's bday</div>
<div>Talking mostly to Eliza</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>6/24</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>things that have happened lately-</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>fasting, just one day tried. cloudiness outside contributing perhaps, but tired, irritable. coffee please? </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking of tinder tag. now ‘okay with confusion’. starting with quirks, values, and sorting of getting somewhere, but nothing catchy, funny, compelling. thinking of juxtaposing ‘an alternate life (weird silly dream of self’ with ‘current life (what i like to do)’. alternate life: object? owl? i don’t know. lego man? cartoon character. some sort of inanimate object.</div>
<div>swiping like it’s a chore - need grlz</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>co-working space. quiet mostly productive sometimes insular. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>smoking w robin. going off on tangents about web development. creating things with pure logic, obsessiveness.</div>
<div>web dev: creating things with pure logic, obsessiveness. love/hate, but mostly mostly good for me and suited to my brain.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>post bridgewater: thinking about brain tendencies and - would love to more concretely know what they are. previously: contradicted with idea of fluid self + could not take criticism, or realize limits. but now, ready, would like to figure out career + path.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>talking to ~me too much lately. sometimes catching self breaking out into small gestures.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>podcasts. most recently: american life about being fat. sam harris (eliza’s recommendation) on drugs as potential tool for mindfulness. specifically: show that altered conscious is possible can motivate meditation? okay sure, me a skeptic but not in that regard. invisibilia about: social norms. mcdonald’s in russia + american fake smiles (expectation for happiness in service industry). 99% invisible - sweden switching from right to left side of driving (beautiful).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in the news: brexit, really?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at night - trouble sleeping because thinking about code. always the potential thought of: okay - what do i do next. how can i structure the next piece?</div>
<div>do i like coding? (me think so)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>headspace liike</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>website in the website living in the website. interactivity mainly working - time-grid filter etc etc. need to just re-structure css.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/26 (weekend)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>laptop near me, saying ‘I SUPPORT THE WAR ON AMERICA BY BATH SALTS'</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>haircut. strolling the neighborhood, options surprisingly narrow.</div>
<div>sitting, unacknowledged in barbershop w/ just one barber. 3 customers. taking time. so bouncing and.</div>
<div>similar deal - one barber, but one customer. </div>
<div>my turn. no acknowledgement after telling him how i would like hair. i like the length on top, i say. most of the haircut sideways. 30 min later, hair gone. a strange symmetrical cut with a little side swipe. accentuating long face. a confined frustration. hats.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>better description - haircut, confined frustration, hats </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>saturday morning shopping in manhattan. nike store first. a spectacle. walking away with size 9 huaraches, conflicted with that and size up - though both really too narrow for feet. option to return. shoes fly as hell, lamenting the ongoing quest to continue to find comfy dope shoes. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>new york attention span lower than in boston. not listening to full songs or albums. shuffling, flipping through. or, step back, not just sitting on subway. compelled to get: extra stimulation of music, even through headphones (w/ layers n layers filtered out).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>balling in the neighborhood (5 min into run, enticed by ball)</div>
<div>then: long chat with michael. about: leaving job / what i’ve been up to / solidified ambitions. brooklyn &amp; what’s like. travel plans. trip to saudi, door’s engagement. mike’s relationship (good, though less time w friends), mental health, plans to do molly. making dinner, eating, and conversation transitioning from agenda to just - chilling. talking about little things and observations. nice and a little heartwarming.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>not going out. coding a little. reading a little? &amp; sleep, 12:30. okay with it, mostly. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>about page -</div>
<div>interested in data as pursuit of truth</div>
<div>code as a way to create with logic</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sat night out. walking 1 hr - design podcast baba linked to as company. interesting actually. designing meaningful interactions, system that holds designers more accountable (sort of like in healthcare). then kelela &amp; friends.</div>
<div>at shannon’s. hi. a mostly harmless looking group. names. the game where you put phone on forehead, describe. </div>
<div>rooftop.</div>
<div>en route - talking to unc senior, aspiring musician. about his process. my dabbling.</div>
<div>‘so brooklyn’. flamboyant gay man in all white (later, pants replaced w cutoff shorts), red high heels. dancing grinding a live Facebook selfie feed. poetry, dry &amp; sometimes funny. poetry, harrowing &amp; racial. comedy - mostly stereotypical. music, folky. dance. mostly confusing. (conversation about making sense of dance afterwards..)</div>
<div>talking to - music guy from brown (name?). 2013 grad, director of music curation at a studio. an attitude of networking, confidence that bleeds into life. walking off with him + dancer to get whiskey. </div>
<div>passing bottle around</div>
<div>talking to - girl who has dance company, works for theater company &amp; does something else? wow. in dc previously. stretching convo out with her and music guy nearby</div>
<div>lover’s and friends, yet again. danz for hour, me and group of mostly girls.</div>
<div>bye, 1:20am. shannon, lena telling me i’m a good dancer? lol.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>podcasts about - myth of personality (invisibilia - reformed prisoner example). my conclusion that personality is response to change in emotional stimuli. or in some ways energy. it’s not your state but the forces that propel you to respond to a new stimulus differently. this needs more thinking.. </div>
<div>and taste (538). algorithms as a means of eliminating human bias. arbitrariness of likes and dislikes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>recurring live dream of like leaving arcadia or them not wanting me and resolving to carve my own path. should get this negativity out before returning to job.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/30</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>waking up. having slept. no crashes noises yells. just, up.</div>
<div>and - a tinder message from 28 yr old saying - ‘you’re too young for me but thought you were cute'</div>
<div>okay. a virtual persona confidence boost.</div>
<div>today, fasting. resolve to: go to taraweeh later</div>
<div>working at father knows best, outdoors</div>
<div>digable planets carrying me through walk. caterpillar monologue.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/29 &amp; this week really (retro from 6/30)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lots of wrist pain</div>
<div>taking breaks before i burn out. result: feel lazy, but constantly fresh, ready to work.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work:</div>
<div>mon/tue css interactions. just a few really, but transitions on: content fading in, buttons popping out, opacity changing, resizes, about page sliding down. happy with landing page, evoking the aesthetic i wanted (and quite quite different from lust.nl). about page interactive timeline taking most of tuesday, trying to get the resize perfect without too many breakpoints.</div>
<div>wed: content page. iterating iterating. looking at fonts, websites. making a standard two column layout (thinking of having slider for image &lt;-&gt; txt sizing). but just..didn’t look pretty. so now, one column, little boxes for each section. maybe progress button.</div>
<div>how will i add new projects / categories? hm.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>7/1</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>to some extent a writing emotional paralysis where barrier is need for ~originality whatever the fuck that it (=cryptic thoughts and writing pseudo depth) </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>studying head frequently. how can i mitigate length of face?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in morning carrying resentment to may? texting wanna get dinner tonight - and ‘nah mama’s bday, maybe sunday’? bday understandable but inferring maybe not hanging out until then? given infrequency of hanging already. feeling like an afterthought. (but get rid of this - may has more friends i’m just one person not that person etc)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in shower how clean can i get before water level rises above ankle?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>brooklyn paying to the highs and lows ebbs and lows</div>
<div>music carrying me again</div>
<div>could maybe use meditation now. distraction. not truly absorbing feeling. or maybe just need more frequent</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>most of time developing website really just refreshing and maybe slightly changing property. taking kevin’s suggestion: work first in greyscale. 30 min trying to make plus sign with divs but always just slightly off. &amp;&amp; some lazy coding, not really feeling re-factoring, writing super efficient tight code.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>progress in liking self, body?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today not fasting.</div>
<div>slow breakfast &amp; meeting with kevin. as usual, just going by showing website..not really asking </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>content portfolio page mainly done. underwhelming but just content is underwhelming.</div>
<div>sometimes thinking maybe i should buy cigarettes </div>
<div>sometimes thinking maybe i should not cook and just buy mexican food</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>not everything has to be deep</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>7/2</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the current situation</div>
<div>father knows best (productivity in the am, promiscuity in the pm). wooden backyard. a large (very) dog, suspended light bulbs, rectangles, mural (cosmic community). in ears, japanese breakfast —</div>
<div>floaty rock (okay non rap cool too) all morning - melody’s echo chamber, upon waking. swooning to layered, intricate sounds, different in each ear. existing in the music, primarily, and analysis, lyrical attention lagging. a sort of dark morning. beautiful sunny perfect weather but loneliness pessimism. rolling around, 30 min or so, tired, not sleeping and just thinking of me me and where are friends.  lingering from last night - meeting people i don’t ‘relate’ to. self-medication: run (despite aching knees). so run, towards ridge wood (queens). landscape different (white people, for one, cleanliness for two). resolve - early on run, to erase this thought of ‘may doesn’t care doesn’t care doesn’t hang with me’ b/c legitimate reasons not to. (though maybe doing nails instead of helping me move questionable - rest = reunions trips and scheduled things). mental cleansing ~sort of working. some resentment to may, but absorbing music, day sun and more clear-headed.</div>
<div>(good lord dog is enormous literally human size no bigger why is this creature in the city)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>mind floating. here in cafe. a reply from may ‘not free, high school reunion’ triggering (&lt;-). flips to website, on desktop, mobile. ticket prices. airbnb. whatsapp to: daryl = bday, mama = itinerary, apology for booking such short trip. texts to robin. Facebook flip, once or twice. (photo of yamak, smiling in makkah w/ caption ‘our faces when we heard there’s albaik next to mosque’. for a short moment, contemplating imagining life. the beauty of Facebook - not the depth or meaning of statuses. but, the short moments where you can imagine another life. or - just imagine the moment this person was writing status. this, more realistic, a small slice of another brain. how long to book trip? how long how long? counting days on finger. airbnb search again then wait i don’t even know this area. shuffling through the cafe - moms &amp; friends, a few local brooklynites. moms &amp; co. mainly. watching giant bug. moving like stop motion animation. there are thoughts there are thoughts. the cups here, a blue outline on the rim, white otherwise. thoughts of - graphic design. do i like that can i do that? the data + datavis prob more meaningful /suited to me than dev + design. conversation with stef on phone. all these..moments i’ve had here. like say - conv with david, night w sabrina, rooftop party, acid trip, general walking around neighborhood. moments. but the sum ending in a ‘been working on this and it’s new and interesting’. the sum and the parts. sum here, much different from parts. in reality, an up and down, somewhat emotionally turbulent - alternate emotionally numb - exploration of self personality myself self conscious my confidence self tendency. boston. the other life. adam vash. coding for good. get good at coding, need to need to. get those skills.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>re-playing conversation with capital a anarchist (david) from last night. a bit too lenient on him. gently directing to flaws in lifestyle, trying to understand motivations behind solid concrete yet incoherent world view. but, given second chance, would have challenged harder. philosophies (bullets b/c coherence difficult to glean). starting with conversation about cargo bikes -&gt; david talking about the bike collective he’s in -&gt; spouting entire philosophy with little prompting.</div>
<div>+ i am privileged and grew up privileged and i’m able to push boundaries (i.e. not pay rent squat steal from corporate things scam)  so i should push the boundaries so that others can? i know this is unfair, but the world is unfair (new tirade). issue: him pushing boundaries does not (necessarily) make it easier for others to push boundaries. system will simply tighten its boundaries, and the few others that don’t have privilege and are exploiting the system will be punished. </div>
<div>+ a ground-up ‘i do what feels right’ approach. or ‘i try to do what makes others feel good’. if others came up to me and told me, for ex, that distributing food to poor people made them feel shitty, weird (why u white people think u angels type thing) then i wouldn’t do it. but - assumption that: others will in fact articulate grievances. and that </div>
<div>+ a worldview that - maybe maybe would work if everyone else was the same way. if everyone else had the same exact view. (though tenuous still). inconsiderate, idealistic, and naive.</div>
<div>+ an unrelenting fuck the cops - or, more broadly, an unrelenting of idea of who is and who isn’t the system. = a reductive, cursory look into what forces are authoritative and oppressive. </div>
<div>+ bike collective &amp; shared labor here. let’s say - a bike app where programmers and delivery people are payed the same. pointing out that delivery people are far more replaceable and actually doing a ‘hm, that’s interesting’. really, not obvious? (this, less of a problem morally).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>+ silly example of how stolen beer encourages sharing but purchased beer does not. so like fuck capitalism.</div>
<div>+ a capitalization on anger. what are you doing to do with anger?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>+ incredibly concrete beliefs, yet: hiding behind the veil of nihilism because it removes accountability. nothing matters so i do what i want. this really is the core, and, if it was the only belief, with all other ideologies thrown out, would be </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>= a selfish lifestyle. living off crevices in the system that he doesn’t need - that other, less privileged people would be less benefited from. (this assuming that crevices are limited, that they aren’t being widened by activity). and taking from others, friends who are working in system. but even if exploiting system is destroying it: at what cost and to whom? the problem is - anarchism is not a real view, and cannot replace a system. you can only be an anarchist if there is a system. if there are apartments to squat, people working jobs to mooch off. if everyone was an anarchist, the world would not subsist. collectivism, communism here more logical. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>clearly giving too much credence, thought into this. though: exercise in understanding people develop identities and beliefs.</div>
<div>a stereotype a walking living stereotype how do you not see yourself as a stereotype?</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div>not standing out, or trying not to stand out. how i’m profiled.</div>
<div>thinking of myself and my brain and my scatter-brain and when i should flex my scatter-brain</div>
<div>conversation with people &amp; strangers a sort of unimaginable thing. like how it lasts long. i mean i know..but how. i should ask the penetrating questions, but they’re not too? &lt;-thought unrelated to interactions, hanging chatting with may and robin, hours each.</div>
<div>apartment smells like seto's</div>
<div>foot pain and swelling</div>
<div>brooklyn weirdly bringing out jordan</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>6/1</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>coming = good choice. shift in mental energy.</div>
<div>morning. 6 hrs not enough, but up, up anyway. forcing food down. working for like only 1-1.5 hr, and then reading and re-reading paragraph.</div>
<div>gym. richie’s gym. enter: concrete, brutal building. no doors, just stores await. posters of upcoming fights scattered, only real decor.</div>
<div>third floor labeled, in tough, thick caps font ‘third floor’. into richie’s a brooklyn bro-type and latino guy running the place. clientele: almost all hispanic and black. many buff buff dudes. weights, old, rusty. but the basics there.</div>
<div>across, elevate train tracks. level.</div>
<div>this is brooklyn, can get widdit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back home, shower, cook chicken. on chair in kitchen, laptop in front, chicken sizzling. nestled, huddled, pseudo-working.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>not 2 much success w dating apps..but like one message from sort of cute risd grad</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>out to coffee shops. first: bushwick public house. one of three clients. waiter barista person, asian, delightful, confident. talking to dutch (?) transplant. then putting on action movie, watching. next to me, black girl, short hair, typing away. and people coming and going on the way. one guy familiar w dutch man, quick conversation about football. but maybe not dutch because then waiter practicing french w him? (outside: the elevate train tracks).</div>
<div>others coming in on bikes.</div>
<div>then: dweebs. small, andro barista. clientele crazy hip, bunny shoes emblematic. looking at designy things on their laptops. words exchanged: ‘oh no, these are my headphones, i think. the cord is wrapped’. all black, flip-flop wearing woman leaving to smoke cigarette outside, after meeting with timid man who asked about my headphones. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home —&gt; working. progressively more productive.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>brooklyn as the perfect unsustainable utopia really. all people interested in creative things + others who are generally cool, want to be around coolness, and will live gritty life to be part of it. amazing .. (thought is deeper than description here)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>explosions in sky song, listening to now, culminating in crazy crazy feedback-induced high-pitched crescendo. head down, taking it in. then song stopping, at once, back to writing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>do i really want to go back to work? maybe just try to move here. why arcadia, really? but arcadia: need to keep up, send message or something.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>things to see. music. things to do. talk to people.</div>
<div>(really should write in day. or when high. but not when tired)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thought catalog project a bit more concrete. thoughts floating from central semantic nodes, but all invisible. sort of floating around. then adding filters to organize. hm. how were filters more concrete? thoughts sifted in lists, perhaps?</div>
<div>how can i make this beautiful and not just structural.</div>
<div>(get loopy and start categorizing patterns)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>when you know songs too well, the feeling today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sometimes i think ‘i’m not going to forget this i’m not i’m not’ and do.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work log:</div>
<div>css layout, all day. all day. float and clear-fix. grasping. fixing my little webpage, aligning things properly. table format, other formats. relative and absolute positioning. in the brain. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>kids don’t say to adults ‘i love adults’. we’re so reductive.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>cs examples (enter text here) as a manifestation of the conscious subconscious</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>book store - molasses</div>
<div>a sign in the restroom ‘jiggle handle if still running’. casual, real. things becoming charming when everything works too well.</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>food simple. this cooked and thrown on this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>bloc, breezing through checkpoints. so far not very worthwhile.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>rest of day.</div>
<div>home and home - cooking, calling nabil.</div>
<div>nabil + marriage. how he sees it as commitment, effort, work. and that’s what he loves</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>6/3 (birthday :o)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>calls from: stef. quite nice. mainly talking about friends from home (nabil’s marriage). how rosie is doing, and tash. marriage, cultural expectations.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on hold w bank of america. hold hold hold, card declined earlier.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a beautiful message from harsh. unlikelihood of us meeting. then: down to earth, witty, creatively talented, and arab/american. him + others thinking i’m a great individual. wow..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a continuation of destructive indecisiveness. buying shoes (8.5), fly jordan’s from shoe store near bushwick/williamsburg. can only try one shoe at a time - with grumpy shopkeeper doling out individual shoes (people run off w shoes, crazy). feeling embarrassed, unable to make decision, until worker basically like ‘just get the 8.5 man’. the 9 bending. but 8.5 too tight on fat right foot. and then home. lesson from stan smith: just size up, and get an insole if needed really. but. wanting. shoes. now. so wearing around house. googling ‘shoe sizing’. all with awareness of how stupid this is, how i’ve done the same thing multiple times..and now, settling on most likely keeping/stretching out b/c canvas?</div>
<div>just. fucking. size. up?</div>
<div>(two-sock method, it turns, worked out, and shoes really did stretch out..hm. confusing, though feeling like less of idiot)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>indecision yielding to deep tiredness, falling asleep, exchanging small talk w robin.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>earlier: working at variety. sort of productive, though course quite dry / not practical now. and no communication from mentor.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(the day, overall, drifting by. finally, resolve to get outside (walk) and casey over just shortly after..</div>
<div>manhattan? williamsburg first. rocking new shoes, feet tight, uncomfortable (should have, should have sized up), baseball-like shirt, black fancy pants. a rather sharp look i think. drink at bourguious place. crowd older, polished. walking, wandering, then - lower east side. scanning streets, few times. </div>
<div>(patchi bailing on bar meet up)</div>
<div>guy named derrick sending us business card promising open bar in hotel. hit a few places, semi-dance/drink, then, like 1am, hotel chantelle. </div>
<div>a long line, skeptical that card will work. bouncer smiles, lets us in.</div>
<div>and derrik, in corner, pouring drinks. birthday, it turns out. 36. many other strangers there? confusing, interesting, situation overall. some swaying before making way back home.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>don’t expect don’t expect in depth calls for bday. friends mostly forgetting, that’s normal natural and i do the same. though the people who do remember, give half-hearted: yo happy bday, like maliha = hm guess we’ve drifted? a message from jade at night, saying - let’s hang out sometime this summer, no worries about drunken night. birthday feelings a recurrence, it seems.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back home ready sleep</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/4</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10:40ish shower up out to park slope - alex rapport’s. (and also, dan, evan)</div>
<div>beautiful, utopian park slope. and tasteful, young intellectual apartment. the structure: sunlight, exposed brick, fresh wooden floors, walls with pre-built character. and furnishment: red table, bright chairs. books books trinkets. should really craigslist harder, thinking..</div>
<div>hi hi to alex what have you been up to. dan in kitchen, preparing waffles. evan rising, following waffle waft shortly after.</div>
<div>diner. vitality, wakefulness w food and coffee. lena alex casey. paralegal life, while waiting for lena. last nights. a happy belated birthday - and casey’s realization that it was my birthday. then lena. gig painting for someone with parkinson’s. &amp; &amp; ..</div>
<div>back to alex’s. chatting to dan about freelance photography life, luring everyone to come to prospect park.</div>
<div>prospect park. around us, mixed crowd, older than bushwick. on blanket, semi-sunny spot, evan playing kaytranada. direct view, bikers struggling to make it up hill. beers, conversation, sun soaking. and frisbee with wesleyan 27 yr old bros.</div>
<div>retreating, sweaty.</div>
<div>a present, flowing not thinking all that much sort of state of mind.</div>
<div>recharge: shower, espresso shot</div>
<div>brooklyn museum first saturday.</div>
<div>inside, family-friendly bumpin. everyone dancing. things like: rihanna/work with heavier drums. beautiful scene, varied economic class it looks, super mixed. outside &amp; projections. writing down thoughts on gentrification - though like are these white people not gentrifiers? or is this primarily on landlord? lena’s gf, shannon, beautiful, engaging, strong eye contact, and happy birthday upon meeting. oh wow amazing hi nice to meet you. and friends: one working at warby parker, and gf who recently quit job.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>saving topics of conversation. a weird thing. do others do this? big things like love/dating</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>life here different pace here different thought pattern different..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>gentrification = the topic. problem = capitalism rewarding money, landlords charging more and more. gov should either reimburse rent differences or force rent control. cool white artsy people who can’t afford nice housing move and hip-ify area -&gt; area = cooler, others w more money attracted -&gt; rent increasing -&gt; residents leaving. needs macro level control, since the money that comes late in gentrification (primarily from businesspeople working away from area that they are gentrifying) doesn’t go directly to gov (and therefore cannot be fed into rent control). instead to companies, outside towns. and money not to local businesses, but new fresh businesses.</div>
<div>my musings, thoughts.</div>
<div>gentrification in some ways inevitable, but need to be mindful, avoid eating at the super hip, support local restaurants and run-down stores.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>post museum, staring at fountain.</div>
<div>burger. dan like - i’m really glad you’re here. caught off guard with noticement, niceness.</div>
<div>bars in crown heights. first, soul night at mostly hip clean place. music a bit too low-key, but a few jamming hard. leaving in search of more bass.</div>
<div>picking up lost ring + rewarded with instant make-out. and later, rejection.</div>
<div>dance dance</div>
<div>patchi &amp; hate for ny, long distance relationship, past few weeks in the city.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>franklin park, the bar. a sort of truce ground. gentrifiers, local community there. an even within locals: spectrum. some people </div>

<div>forgetting about life. the elements of life that constitute continuity. family.</div>

<div>Racing </div>
<div>Excited about things in making </div>
<div>Trumpets in rap nostalgia </div>
<div>May by my side </div>
<div>Stepping back </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thank god 6/8 not 6/9 b/c then less journaling</div>
<div>heavens</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>walking may to the train station in circular route. this neighborhood. the almost orchestrated grit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the bushwhack hipsters and yearning for an earlier fictional nostalgic age</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>smoking robin’s ‘awake’ weed</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>loving casey’s bro’s website. blue popping font and beautiful typeface type shit</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>them too big air jordan 1’s can’t return humiliation </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hm thought / background noise not seeming legitimate. journal as a source of data?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>portfolio project classifications </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the usual thought of fluid personality resonating after an article of similar opinion</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>news checks shorter in new york. music, free time, things, shorter. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>too busy to talk to myself</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/9</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>refreshed &amp; born - but not sure why</div>
<div>day feeling - stifled. unsure where to work.</div>
<div>first tour at co-working spaces. one like okay but really 25/day?</div>
<div>and then air jordan 1 i couldn’t return b/c tried on too hard (really) hurting feet and feet hurt and i have made no progress in that front</div>
<div>(sat morning = shopping !) or thurs or some other day</div>
<div>but working spaces not working so nearby cafe instead, twin peaks themed. aka few twin peaks posters.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>20-25 min walk from myrtle-wychoff but people different. less grunge hipster (though present present). odd business-men or old ladies saying dear. williamsburg-looking older people. white. guy wearing raggedy clothing, talking about some sort of manual labor? portugese girl near me mixing languages elegantly. guy and woman, not dating (most likely). guy devouring devouring bagel. not just hungry or eating fast. but focused. looking at bagel. choosing the right posture/stance to maximize bite. other woman joining after. little comments made, many with bagel in mouth. focused on people </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>self-esteem maybe going up with few more tinder matches (really) &amp; realizing bumble has weird ranking system that throws people who either 1) don’t respond or 2) mass swipe (me) to bottom of pile. hmkay.</div>
<div>how to start conversations, now..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back to dweeb’s. the spot. energy level perfect. nearby, semi-flamboyant tall blonde in tank + black hair black black + denim tats u know the type talking about ‘shows’. dude organizing burlesque shows? hm. clients. dancers &amp; descriptions, amid bloc.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>continuing w/ bloc jams. jQuery refactor. useful tidbit of day: setting function as listener - w parameters - without calling function. basically .click(function() {function w params}) type of thing. seeing that foundation is helping me shortcut through some things i would have googled over and over, props will help me structure apps more quickly. trouble following directions though, program working but diverging from bloc’s. (play-pause-next functionality in bloc-jams..)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>music cafe hipster grunge 2 much in head</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home. laundry. mexican music blasting (blasting everywhere really..whizzing through my head, further disorienting).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>getting high last night helping me realize realize really where i am. like looking around brooklyn wow zah.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>—being refreshed. on that. laundry. drying cycle: disappearing into article about school segregation. ny incredibly segregated, little policy trying to fight this. but anyway. heat from drying machines. phone screen. physical sensations. but rapt in article. then home and - music. oo ah relaxing music not from cafes chosen by me. dj koze. laundry away, impromptu room reshuffling (hey this nice can work here). food. really standard mundane but needed - space - music - ability to reflect - to feel good.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5/11 (sat)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>11am up, slight hangover </div>
<div>Making toast</div>
<div>Complex toast, Sabrina calls it. Burnt (yes, intentionally) cinnamon; peanut butter, banana.</div>
<div>Sabrina up.</div>
<div>Naked and in bed. Cuddling, listening to: a fan-induced squeak. Poster rattling on walk. Sounding like: starving kitten. Sounds from street shuffling in. Hispanic music, conversation, birds. Cries. Things.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Checking time: 3:30. Oh shit. A tiger shirt (complement) &amp; preparations to leave. Breakfast at: dweebs. There the conversation like: friends smart and friends theses and some really shitty instagram experimental theses. Sabrina: rhetorical analysis of language used by peta, similarity to civil rights movement. Me: not zapping monkeys. Talking to strangers. &amp;&amp;</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Back home: finding a tootsie pop on desk. Emptied from pockets. Indicator of: memory loss. Or nature of it. Because when sober, you expect to forget many trivial things (when you went to bathroom for ex) - but not forget how tootsie pop was lost. What's feeding perception of memory </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/12</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Morning hi robin and friends then gym</div>
<div>Working at kave. Coffee shop nestled in small hip complex. </div>
<div>Delving into 1 hour convo with two native Manhattan parents. Prompted by: 'you, what do you do for a living?'. As in, why are you working at this coffee shop?  Explaining explaining listening. Women: makes puppets now. Used to be audio engineer for brain eno. Worked at bank, did other things. Now tho, puppets and newspaper clippings. Husband, fitness trainer (shows). (Recalling a women's envy: 'you just do what you want')</div>
<div>Yay conversations with strangers</div>
<div>Like I'm opening up </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Stopping by robin's bike shop. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Boiler room. Well shmancy dinner w may, Greenpoint. Looking like Park Slope.</div>
<div>Following experimental edm bro, guy with turntable tatted playing abrasive beats. Getting places with experiment tho, and eventually bringing on flamboyant passionate rapper. </div>
<div>Show begins.</div>
<div>Dance 4 hours</div>
<div>Hi Ryan Glassman</div>
<div>Hi Emma's friends</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/13 </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Portfolio design.</div>
<div>Meeting may at dweeb's and ah I can't take this. Until 5:30. </div>
<div>Then more.</div>
<div>Combo of: sketch designs, physical sketch, scattered notes, and portfolio oogling.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At night: browsing pretty vertical scrolly portfolio's that take user through linear narrative. And like: is this just better?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Too many design thoughts in bed </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/14</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Portfolio design continuing. </div>
<div>At the moment; no longer hating 3D diagonal card arrangement. Could be a unique site. </div>
<div>Cobalt blue font, fold out pages </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Through Brownsville </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Running to L train in Brownsville, knocking blind lady's cane. In a blur, flylo playing through, apologies sprouting </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Crown heights</div>
<div>Sharon's place - for July / $580 a month. Clean nice near museum. Wide street. Orthodox Jews </div>
<div>The word: thickly settled.</div>
<div>to the left, black people to right.</div>
<div>Dominican food in crowded mini restaurant. Asking man, 'what to order?'</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/15 and 6/16</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Morning spirit lifted a bit as design is affirmed for website. Designing about page, content, then semi working w Jekyll. </div>
<div>Nap then to </div>
<div>Mays</div>
<div>2 full express trains, missing. Noting graphic design of signs.</div>
<div>College kids in</div>
<div>A sort of half greeting from the girls. Marshall and Grif super friendly. Also incidentally tripping.</div>
<div>Milling about and wondering where to put my body.</div>
<div>Waiting waiting stalled by joints </div>
<div>Then out the door</div>
<div>Trains</div>
<div>Feeling long</div>
<div>At prospect park a beautiful beautiful day </div>
<div>Debating tripping and deciding no </div>
<div>Inside the park venue</div>
<div>Worrying about tickets then finding a place to sit, smoke. Getting instantly high (Popsicle taste intensifying as evidence) and deciding: half a tab.</div>
<div>Eventually crowd wandering, separated behind may Amanda by tall dude. Near the becky's little bro who just finished high school. </div>
<div>An opening band that the crowd liked but was somewhat irritating. French. Layers not melding. Glad I have taste still on acid.</div>
<div>Crowd paranoia. Is everyone looking at me, laughing at me? Talking about me? Knowing that can't be true but it feels like it..</div>
<div>Tame impala finally on.</div>
<div>At first currents I think.</div>
<div>Thinking: damn they got some beats. Really. And getting down.</div>
<div>Mind mischief </div>
<div>Beginning to 'confront' issues: </div>
<div>Sharing a ridiculous thought and may like shaking head. And then feeling stupid. I shouldn't feel bad. This is okay. A sort of feigned lucidity?</div>
<div>Sensitive to: may's acknowledgement of me. Things I say, how others perceive me.</div>
<div> like everyone is watching laughing talking about me. I know it's not real but seeing it happen, subtly. </div>
<div>Getting down to: why won't she talk to me? Others too. Lyrics so drawn out and just swaying singing to me.</div>
<div>Brain wandering in?</div>
<div>Weird animations</div>
<div>This beautiful beautiful young looking but I think my age girl. Face perfect.</div>
<div>Again - try to talk to may. I l think share something funny? Or trivial but like a hey here's a piece of my brain. Shot down. May looking at crooked hat. Confiscating, and not asking about anything else.</div>
<div>Hm okay.</div>
<div>How I can sort of imagine interactions w people.</div>
<div>Not really feeling warmth. From this crew. hm.</div>
<div>Maybe trip was normal? but at some point, exploring every open crevice in brain.</div>
<div>May wanting to head outside crowd. So much a part of music right now I'm not even listening to it. So yes.</div>
<div>Outside. Alternatingly sitting and standing. Enjoying music at both paces. Feeling air. And pulled in.</div>
<div>The concert actually really great. not wanting to end. Feels like we only go backwards.</div>
<div>Really sort of contemplating tame impala lyrics. Or for certain songs where mind went all over the place. Like is this song. That's amazing if it allowed my mind to wander like that..</div>
<div>But thinking</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Leaving concert to go to Hope's car. Straightedge. In a sort of wasteland in the city? Cars, only.</div>
<div>Then, in park slope. Recognizing area.</div>
<div>Figuring out trains, eventually.</div>
<div>The Q home comfortable but feeling like I'm pulling body together.</div>
<div>Listening to: now and for next few hours, camp talk.</div>
<div>Falafel guys. Egyptian guy practicing English and joking. Asking 'where you from?' To clearly white American girl.</div>
<div>Body </div>
<div>The same intense urge to pull skin out.</div>
<div>Waiting for bed.</div>
<div>W may, fidgeting so much it drives her to couch.</div>
<div>Notice this, in the morning. And feeling bad regretful my brain was fine fine should I always welcome disruption like this?</div>
<div>Clenching </div>
<div>Feeling face bone structure </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/16 morning </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A bit defeated. In a nothing can satisfy mood. Walking on street and pace is odd, noticing and zooming on people.  </div>
<div>A bit better as I write about trip</div>
<div>Wasn't like bad</div>
<div>Just mentally exhausting.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/18</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today like</div>
<div>revisiting post acid weirdness</div>
<div>and reading journal</div>

<div>decide: best not to play if i need to pee and there is no bathroom and i may have to leave for a bathroom</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and thinking: i have nothing to write about what am i?</div>

<div>getting into bk ~12:30 doing it late nye style</div>
<div>realizing: not that much time chilling with may in ny.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div>and morning after</div>
<div>blerghling all over the place</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ideas for interactive code writing.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<hr/>
<div>5/30 - </div>
<div>getting to may’s.</div>
<div>there. a stop at duane reade -&gt; smoking. watching rick and morty. plot line getting progressively more complex, but unraveling and winding in a brilliant way. can’t remember content, just nature of progression.</div>
<div>maybe upset (just a tinge) at face that may can’t make bday? and move-in? and leaving in a bit for LA. hm. all fair choices. can’t expect her to miss an entire weekend for me..</div>
<div>sleep, early wake up.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>write to live live to write.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5/31 - </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>move in. hour journey, suitcase over turnstiles.</div>
<div>sitting on steps, seeing lena walk by, bagel in hand. carrying sunshine. chatting, unpacking.</div>
<div>a bit of work.</div>
<div>apartment dingy, dirty. room, pretty good (though a little hot). aim of summer is, mainly to work. why did i leave comfy slow boston for dirty noisy fascinating brooklyn?</div>
<div>variety coffee shop. </div>
<div>stroll &amp; home. work.</div>
<div>robin. each of us buzzing with awkward energy. things like: being reformed slacker. canadian/arab. upbringing, conservative/racist in family strain, but parents liberal. travels, traveler vs tourist. the brain. the brain. consciousness. and my neuroscience research. invitation to crazy noise rock show, missing out.</div>
<div>may over, 9 pm. cooking dinner. resources low, kitchen small. a usual ambiguous not-curry not-stir-fry deal.</div>
<div>chance echoing.</div>
<div>immersed in talk of?</div>
<div>then, walking around the neighborhood. &amp; drinks.</div>
<div>a sort of timid energy around myself, an imaginary dynamic where may is feeling responsible for introduction to hood, cheering up? something like this?</div>
<div>not standing out, or trying not to stand out. how i’m profiled.</div>
<div>thinking of myself and my brain and my scatter-brain and when i should flex my scatter-brain</div>
<div>conversation with people &amp; strangers a sort of unimaginable thing. like how it lasts long. i mean i know..but how. i should ask the penetrating questions, but they’re not too? &lt;-thought unrelated to interactions, hanging chatting with may and robin, hours each.</div>
<div>apartment smells like seto's</div>
<div>foot pain and swelling</div>
<div>brooklyn weirdly bringing out jordan</div>
<div>brutalist websites</div>
<div>saying goodbye to may - man stopping us to ask for change, and spout absolute gibberish</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/1</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>coming = good choice. shift in mental energy.</div>
<div>morning. 6 hrs not enough, but up, up anyway. forcing food down. working for like only 1-1.5 hr, and then reading and re-reading paragraph.</div>
<div>gym. richie’s gym. enter: concrete, brutal building. no doors, just stores await. posters of upcoming fights scattered, only real decor.</div>
<div>third floor labeled, in tough, thick caps font ‘third floor’. into richie’s a brooklyn bro-type and latino guy running the place. clientele: almost all hispanic and black. many buff buff dudes. weights, old, rusty. but the basics there.</div>
<div>across, elevate train tracks. level.</div>
<div>this is brooklyn, can get widdit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back home, shower, cook chicken. on chair in kitchen, laptop in front, chicken sizzling. nestled, huddled, pseudo-working.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>not 2 much success w dating apps..but like one message from sort of cute risd grad</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>out to coffee shops. first: bushwick public house. one of three clients. waiter barista person, asian, delightful, confident. talking to dutch (?) transplant. then putting on action movie, watching. next to me, black girl, short hair, typing away. and people coming and going on the way. one guy familiar w dutch man, quick conversation about football. but maybe not dutch because then waiter practicing french w him? (outside: the elevate train tracks).</div>
<div>others coming in on bikes.</div>
<div>then: dweebs. small, andro barista. clientele crazy hip, bunny shoes emblematic. looking at designy things on their laptops. words exchanged: ‘oh no, these are my headphones, i think. the cord is wrapped’. all black, flip-flop wearing woman leaving to smoke cigarette outside, after meeting with timid man who asked about my headphones. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home —&gt; working. progressively more productive.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>brooklyn as the perfect unsustainable utopia really. all people interested in creative things + others who are generally cool, want to be around coolness, and will live gritty life to be part of it. amazing .. (thought is deeper than description here)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>explosions in sky song, listening to now, culminating in crazy crazy feedback-induced high-pitched crescendo. head down, taking it in. then song stopping, at once, back to writing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>do i really want to go back to work? maybe just try to move here. why arcadia, really? but arcadia: need to keep up, send message or something.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>things to see. music. things to do. talk to people.</div>
<div>(really should write in day. or when high. but not when tired)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thought catalog project a bit more concrete. thoughts floating from central semantic nodes, but all invisible. sort of floating around. then adding filters to organize. hm. how were filters more concrete? thoughts sifted in lists, perhaps?</div>
<div>how can i make this beautiful and not just structural.</div>
<div>(get loopy and start categorizing patterns)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>when you know songs too well, the feeling today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sometimes i think ‘i’m not going to forget this i’m not i’m not’ and do.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work log:</div>
<div>css layout, all day. all day. float and clear-fix. grasping. fixing my little webpage, aligning things properly. table format, other formats. relative and absolute positioning. in the brain. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>kids don’t say to adults ‘i love adults’. we’re so reductive.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>cs examples (enter text here) as a manifestation of the conscious subconscious</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>book store - molasses</div>
<div>a sign in the restroom ‘jiggle handle if still running’. casual, real. things becoming charming when everything works too well.</div>
<div>mindfulness not needed when things are in your face.</div>
<div>a chat about - poetry book related to logic. generative poetry based on images. (the programmer artist)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home. checking - coffee shops? then, no, i can stay here. 10 minutes later, still checking coffee shops - so fuck it / leave</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>food simple. this cooked and thrown on this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>bloc, breezing through checkpoints. so far not very worthwhile.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>rest of day.</div>
<div>home and home - cooking, calling nabil.</div>
<div>nabil + marriage. how he sees it as commitment, effort, work. and that’s what he loves</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then chat w kareem.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and - again. the shoe size dilemma. just. fucking. size. up?</div>
<div>wow. a 3 hour </div>
<div>talk w kareem</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>standing may up</div>
<div>at the bar</div>
<div>turtle</div>
<div>chats</div>
<div>etc etc</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/3 (birthday :o)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>calls from: stef. quite nice. mainly talking about friends from home (nabil’s marriage). how rosie is doing, and tash. marriage, cultural expectations.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on hold w bank of america. hold hold hold, card declined earlier.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a beautiful message from harsh. unlikelihood of us meeting. then: down to earth, witty, creatively talented, and arab/american. him + others thinking i’m a great individual. wow..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a continuation of destructive indecisiveness. buying shoes (8.5), fly jordan’s from shoe store near bushwick/williamsburg. can only try one shoe at a time - with grumpy shopkeeper doling out individual shoes (people run off w shoes, crazy). feeling embarrassed, unable to make decision, until worker basically like ‘just get the 8.5 man’. the 9 bending. but 8.5 too tight on fat right foot. and then home. lesson from stan smith: just size up, and get an insole if needed really. but. wanting. shoes. now. so wearing around house. googling ‘shoe sizing’. all with awareness of how stupid this is, how i’ve done the same thing multiple times..and now, settling on most likely keeping/stretching out b/c canvas?</div>
<div>just. fucking. size. up?</div>
<div>(two-sock method, it turns, worked out, and shoes really did stretch out..hm. confusing, though feeling like less of idiot)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>indecision yielding to deep tiredness, falling asleep, exchanging small talk w robin.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>earlier: working at variety. sort of productive, though course quite dry / not practical now. and no communication from mentor.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(the day, overall, drifting by. finally, resolve to get outside (walk) and casey over just shortly after..</div>
<div>manhattan? williamsburg first. rocking new shoes, feet tight, uncomfortable (should have, should have sized up), baseball-like shirt, black fancy pants. a rather sharp look i think. drink at bourguious place. crowd older, polished. walking, wandering, then - lower east side. scanning streets, few times. </div>
<div>(patchi bailing on bar meet up)</div>
<div>guy named derrick sending us business card promising open bar in hotel. hit a few places, semi-dance/drink, then, like 1am, hotel chantelle. </div>
<div>a long line, skeptical that card will work. bouncer smiles, lets us in.</div>
<div>and derrik, in corner, pouring drinks. birthday, it turns out. 36. many other strangers there? confusing, interesting, situation overall. some swaying before making way back home.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>don’t expect don’t expect in depth calls for bday. friends mostly forgetting, that’s normal natural and i do the same. though the people who do remember, give half-hearted: yo happy bday, like maliha = hm guess we’ve drifted? a message from jade at night, saying - let’s hang out sometime this summer, no worries about drunken night. birthday feelings a recurrence, it seems.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back home ready sleep</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/4</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10:40ish shower up out to park slope - alex rapport’s. (and also, dan, evan)</div>
<div>beautiful, utopian park slope. and tasteful, young intellectual apartment. the structure: sunlight, exposed brick, fresh wooden floors, walls with pre-built character. and furnishment: red table, bright chairs. books books trinkets. should really craigslist harder, thinking..</div>
<div>hi hi to alex what have you been up to. dan in kitchen, preparing waffles. evan rising, following waffle waft shortly after.</div>
<div>diner. vitality, wakefulness w food and coffee. lena alex casey. paralegal life, while waiting for lena. last nights. a happy belated birthday - and casey’s realization that it was my birthday. then lena. gig painting for someone with parkinson’s. &amp; &amp; ..</div>
<div>back to alex’s. chatting to dan about freelance photography life, luring everyone to come to prospect park.</div>
<div>prospect park. around us, mixed crowd, older than bushwick. on blanket, semi-sunny spot, evan playing kaytranada. direct view, bikers struggling to make it up hill. beers, conversation, sun soaking. and frisbee with wesleyan 27 yr old bros.</div>
<div>retreating, sweaty.</div>
<div>a present, flowing not thinking all that much sort of state of mind.</div>
<div>recharge: shower, espresso shot</div>
<div>brooklyn museum first saturday.</div>
<div>inside, family-friendly bumpin. everyone dancing. things like: rihanna/work with heavier drums. beautiful scene, varied economic class it looks, super mixed. outside &amp; projections. writing down thoughts on gentrification - though like are these white people not gentrifiers? or is this primarily on landlord? lena’s gf, shannon, beautiful, engaging, strong eye contact, and happy birthday upon meeting. oh wow amazing hi nice to meet you. and friends: one working at warby parker, and gf who recently quit job.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>saving topics of conversation. a weird thing. do others do this? big things like love/dating</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>life here different pace here different thought pattern different..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>gentrification = the topic. problem = capitalism rewarding money, landlords charging more and more. gov should either reimburse rent differences or force rent control. cool white artsy people who can’t afford nice housing move and hip-ify area -&gt; area = cooler, others w more money attracted -&gt; rent increasing -&gt; residents leaving. needs macro level control, since the money that comes late in gentrification (primarily from businesspeople working away from area that they are gentrifying) doesn’t go directly to gov (and therefore cannot be fed into rent control). instead to companies, outside towns. and money not to local businesses, but new fresh businesses.</div>
<div>my musings, thoughts.</div>
<div>gentrification in some ways inevitable, but need to be mindful, avoid eating at the super hip, support local restaurants and run-down stores.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>post museum, staring at fountain.</div>
<div>burger. dan like - i’m really glad you’re here. caught off guard with noticement, niceness.</div>
<div>bars in crown heights. first, soul night at mostly hip clean place. music a bit too low-key, but a few jamming hard. leaving in search of more bass.</div>
<div>picking up lost ring + rewarded with instant make-out. and later, rejection.</div>
<div>dance dance</div>
<div>patchi &amp; hate for ny, long distance relationship, past few weeks in the city.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>franklin park, the bar. a sort of truce ground. gentrifiers, local community there. an even within locals: spectrum. some people </div>
<div>one orthodox jew, and, anna zeidman’s bumble date, walking in with infinite jest in hand.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>

<div>james blake / music to awaken, ground me. not much time to listen to music lately.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>when the environment is the focus:</div>
<div>reflection, set behind, can’t keep up w present</div>
<div>forgetting about life. the elements of life that constitute continuity. family.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>down about love. low tinder / bumble / real life success. hit gym hard, feel better + more secure?</div>

<div>Trumpets in rap nostalgia </div>
<div>May by my side </div>
<div>Stepping back </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thank god 6/8 not 6/9 b/c then less journaling</div>
<div>heavens</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>walking may to the train station in circular route. this neighborhood. the almost orchestrated grit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the bushwhack hipsters and yearning for an earlier fictional nostalgic age</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>smoking robin’s ‘awake’ weed</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>loving casey’s bro’s website. blue popping font and beautiful typeface type shit</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>them too big air jordan 1’s can’t return humiliation </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hm thought / background noise not seeming legitimate. journal as a source of data?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>portfolio project classifications </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the usual thought of fluid personality resonating after an article of similar opinion</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>news checks shorter in new york. music, free time, things, shorter. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>too busy to talk to myself</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/9</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>refreshed &amp; born - but not sure why</div>
<div>day feeling - stifled. unsure where to work.</div>
<div>first tour at co-working spaces. one like okay but really 25/day?</div>
<div>and then air jordan 1 i couldn’t return b/c tried on too hard (really) hurting feet and feet hurt and i have made no progress in that front</div>
<div>(sat morning = shopping !) or thurs or some other day</div>
<div>but working spaces not working so nearby cafe instead, twin peaks themed. aka few twin peaks posters.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>20-25 min walk from myrtle-wychoff but people different. less grunge hipster (though present present). odd business-men or old ladies saying dear. williamsburg-looking older people. white. guy wearing raggedy clothing, talking about some sort of manual labor? portugese girl near me mixing languages elegantly. guy and woman, not dating (most likely). guy devouring devouring bagel. not just hungry or eating fast. but focused. looking at bagel. choosing the right posture/stance to maximize bite. other woman joining after. little comments made, many with bagel in mouth. focused on people </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>self-esteem maybe going up with few more tinder matches (really) &amp; realizing bumble has weird ranking system that throws people who either 1) don’t respond or 2) mass swipe (me) to bottom of pile. hmkay.</div>
<div>how to start conversations, now..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back to dweeb’s. the spot. energy level perfect. nearby, semi-flamboyant tall blonde in tank + black hair black black + denim tats u know the type talking about ‘shows’. dude organizing burlesque shows? hm. clients. dancers &amp; descriptions, amid bloc.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>continuing w/ bloc jams. jQuery refactor. useful tidbit of day: setting function as listener - w parameters - without calling function. basically .click(function() {function w params}) type of thing. seeing that foundation is helping me shortcut through some things i would have googled over and over, props will help me structure apps more quickly. trouble following directions though, program working but diverging from bloc’s. (play-pause-next functionality in bloc-jams..)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>music cafe hipster grunge 2 much in head</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home. laundry. mexican music blasting (blasting everywhere really..whizzing through my head, further disorienting).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>getting high last night helping me realize realize really where i am. like looking around brooklyn wow zah.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>—being refreshed. on that. laundry. drying cycle: disappearing into article about school segregation. ny incredibly segregated, little policy trying to fight this. but anyway. heat from drying machines. phone screen. physical sensations. but rapt in article. then home and - music. oo ah relaxing music not from cafes chosen by me. dj koze. laundry away, impromptu room reshuffling (hey this nice can work here). food. really standard mundane but needed - space - music - ability to reflect - to feel good.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5/11 (sat)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>11am up, slight hangover </div>
<div>Making toast</div>
<div>Complex toast, Sabrina calls it. Burnt (yes, intentionally) cinnamon; peanut butter, banana.</div>
<div>Sabrina up.</div>
<div>Naked and in bed. Cuddling, listening to: a fan-induced squeak. Poster rattling on walk. Sounding like: starving kitten. Sounds from street shuffling in. Hispanic music, conversation, birds. Cries. Things.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Checking time: 3:30. Oh shit. A tiger shirt (complement) &amp; preparations to leave. Breakfast at: dweebs. There the conversation like: friends smart and friends theses and some really shitty instagram experimental theses. Sabrina: rhetorical analysis of language used by peta, similarity to civil rights movement. Me: not zapping monkeys. Talking to strangers. &amp;&amp;</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Back home: finding a tootsie pop on desk. Emptied from pockets. Indicator of: memory loss. Or nature of it. Because when sober, you expect to forget many trivial things (when you went to bathroom for ex) - but not forget how tootsie pop was lost. What's feeding perception of memory </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/12</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Morning hi robin and friends then gym</div>
<div>Working at kave. Coffee shop nestled in small hip complex. </div>
<div>Delving into 1 hour convo with two native Manhattan parents. Prompted by: 'you, what do you do for a living?'. As in, why are you working at this coffee shop?  Explaining explaining listening. Women: makes puppets now. Used to be audio engineer for brain eno. Worked at bank, did other things. Now tho, puppets and newspaper clippings. Husband, fitness trainer (shows). (Recalling a women's envy: 'you just do what you want')</div>
<div>Yay conversations with strangers</div>
<div>Like I'm opening up </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Stopping by robin's bike shop. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Boiler room. Well shmancy dinner w may, Greenpoint. Looking like Park Slope.</div>
<div>Following experimental edm bro, guy with turntable tatted playing abrasive beats. Getting places with experiment tho, and eventually bringing on flamboyant passionate rapper. </div>
<div>Show begins.</div>
<div>Dance 4 hours</div>
<div>Hi Ryan Glassman</div>
<div>Hi Emma's friends</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/13 </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Portfolio design.</div>
<div>Meeting may at dweeb's and ah I can't take this. Until 5:30. </div>
<div>Then more.</div>
<div>Combo of: sketch designs, physical sketch, scattered notes, and portfolio oogling.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At night: browsing pretty vertical scrolly portfolio's that take user through linear narrative. And like: is this just better?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Too many design thoughts in bed </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/14</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Portfolio design continuing. </div>
<div>At the moment; no longer hating 3D diagonal card arrangement. Could be a unique site. </div>
<div>Cobalt blue font, fold out pages </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Through Brownsville </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Running to L train in Brownsville, knocking blind lady's cane. In a blur, flylo playing through, apologies sprouting </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Crown heights</div>
<div>Sharon's place - for July / $580 a month. Clean nice near museum. Wide street. Orthodox Jews </div>
<div>The word: thickly settled.</div>
<div>to the left, black people to right.</div>
<div>Dominican food in crowded mini restaurant. Asking man, 'what to order?'</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/15 and 6/16</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Morning spirit lifted a bit as design is affirmed for website. Designing about page, content, then semi working w Jekyll. </div>
<div>Nap then to </div>
<div>Mays</div>
<div>2 full express trains, missing. Noting graphic design of signs.</div>
<div>College kids in</div>
<div>A sort of half greeting from the girls. Marshall and Grif super friendly. Also incidentally tripping.</div>
<div>Milling about and wondering where to put my body.</div>
<div>Waiting waiting stalled by joints </div>
<div>Then out the door</div>
<div>Trains</div>
<div>Feeling long</div>
<div>At prospect park a beautiful beautiful day </div>
<div>Debating tripping and deciding no </div>
<div>Inside the park venue</div>
<div>Worrying about tickets then finding a place to sit, smoke. Getting instantly high (Popsicle taste intensifying as evidence) and deciding: half a tab.</div>
<div>Eventually crowd wandering, separated behind may Amanda by tall dude. Near the becky's little bro who just finished high school. </div>
<div>An opening band that the crowd liked but was somewhat irritating. French. Layers not melding. Glad I have taste still on acid.</div>
<div>Crowd paranoia. Is everyone looking at me, laughing at me? Talking about me? Knowing that can't be true but it feels like it..</div>
<div>Tame impala finally on.</div>
<div>At first currents I think.</div>
<div>Thinking: damn they got some beats. Really. And getting down.</div>
<div>Mind mischief </div>
<div>Beginning to 'confront' issues: </div>
<div>Sharing a ridiculous thought and may like shaking head. And then feeling stupid. I shouldn't feel bad. This is okay. A sort of feigned lucidity?</div>
<div>Sensitive to: may's acknowledgement of me. Things I say, how others perceive me.</div>
<div> like everyone is watching laughing talking about me. I know it's not real but seeing it happen, subtly. </div>
<div>Getting down to: why won't she talk to me? Others too. Lyrics so drawn out and just swaying singing to me.</div>
<div>Brain wandering in?</div>
<div>Weird animations</div>
<div>This beautiful beautiful young looking but I think my age girl. Face perfect.</div>
<div>Again - try to talk to may. I l think share something funny? Or trivial but like a hey here's a piece of my brain. Shot down. May looking at crooked hat. Confiscating, and not asking about anything else.</div>
<div>Hm okay.</div>
<div>How I can sort of imagine interactions w people.</div>
<div>Not really feeling warmth. From this crew. hm.</div>
<div>Maybe trip was normal? but at some point, exploring every open crevice in brain.</div>
<div>May wanting to head outside crowd. So much a part of music right now I'm not even listening to it. So yes.</div>
<div>Outside. Alternatingly sitting and standing. Enjoying music at both paces. Feeling air. And pulled in.</div>
<div>The concert actually really great. not wanting to end. Feels like we only go backwards.</div>
<div>Really sort of contemplating tame impala lyrics. Or for certain songs where mind went all over the place. Like is this song. That's amazing if it allowed my mind to wander like that..</div>
<div>But thinking</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Leaving concert to go to Hope's car. Straightedge. In a sort of wasteland in the city? Cars, only.</div>
<div>Then, in park slope. Recognizing area.</div>
<div>Figuring out trains, eventually.</div>
<div>The Q home comfortable but feeling like I'm pulling body together.</div>
<div>Listening to: now and for next few hours, camp talk.</div>
<div>Falafel guys. Egyptian guy practicing English and joking. Asking 'where you from?' To clearly white American girl.</div>
<div>Body </div>
<div>The same intense urge to pull skin out.</div>
<div>Waiting for bed.</div>
<div>W may, fidgeting so much it drives her to couch.</div>
<div>Notice this, in the morning. And feeling bad regretful my brain was fine fine should I always welcome disruption like this?</div>
<div>Clenching </div>
<div>Feeling face bone structure </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/16 morning </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A bit defeated. In a nothing can satisfy mood. Walking on street and pace is odd, noticing and zooming on people.  </div>
<div>A bit better as I write about trip</div>
<div>Wasn't like bad</div>
<div>Just mentally exhausting.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/18</div>

<div>thinking of tinder tag. now ‘okay with confusion’. starting with quirks, values, and sorting of getting somewhere, but nothing catchy, funny, compelling. thinking of juxtaposing ‘an alternate life (weird silly dream of self’ with ‘current life (what i like to do)’. alternate life: object? owl? i don’t know. lego man? cartoon character. some sort of inanimate object.</div>
<div>swiping like it’s a chore - need grlz</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>co-working space. quiet mostly productive sometimes insular. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>smoking w robin. going off on tangents about web development. creating things with pure logic, obsessiveness.</div>
<div>web dev: creating things with pure logic, obsessiveness. love/hate, but mostly mostly good for me and suited to my brain.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>post bridgewater: thinking about brain tendencies and - would love to more concretely know what they are. previously: contradicted with idea of fluid self + could not take criticism, or realize limits. but now, ready, would like to figure out career + path.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>talking to ~me too much lately. sometimes catching self breaking out into small gestures.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>podcasts. most recently: american life about being fat. sam harris (eliza’s recommendation) on drugs as potential tool for mindfulness. specifically: show that altered conscious is possible can motivate meditation? okay sure, me a skeptic but not in that regard. invisibilia about: social norms. mcdonald’s in russia + american fake smiles (expectation for happiness in service industry). 99% invisible - sweden switching from right to left side of driving (beautiful).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in the news: brexit, really?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at night - trouble sleeping because thinking about code. always the potential thought of: okay - what do i do next. how can i structure the next piece?</div>
<div>do i like coding? (me think so)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>headspace liike</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>website in the website living in the website. interactivity mainly working - time-grid filter etc etc. need to just re-structure css.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/26 (weekend)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>laptop near me, saying ‘I SUPPORT THE WAR ON AMERICA BY BATH SALTS'</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>haircut. strolling the neighborhood, options surprisingly narrow.</div>
<div>sitting, unacknowledged in barbershop w/ just one barber. 3 customers. taking time. so bouncing and.</div>
<div>similar deal - one barber, but one customer. </div>
<div>my turn. no acknowledgement after telling him how i would like hair. i like the length on top, i say. most of the haircut sideways. 30 min later, hair gone. a strange symmetrical cut with a little side swipe. accentuating long face. a confined frustration. hats.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>better description - haircut, confined frustration, hats </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>saturday morning shopping in manhattan. nike store first. a spectacle. walking away with size 9 huaraches, conflicted with that and size up - though both really too narrow for feet. option to return. shoes fly as hell, lamenting the ongoing quest to continue to find comfy dope shoes. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>new york attention span lower than in boston. not listening to full songs or albums. shuffling, flipping through. or, step back, not just sitting on subway. compelled to get: extra stimulation of music, even through headphones (w/ layers n layers filtered out).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>balling in the neighborhood (5 min into run, enticed by ball)</div>
<div>then: long chat with michael. about: leaving job / what i’ve been up to / solidified ambitions. brooklyn &amp; what’s like. travel plans. trip to saudi, door’s engagement. mike’s relationship (good, though less time w friends), mental health, plans to do molly. making dinner, eating, and conversation transitioning from agenda to just - chilling. talking about little things and observations. nice and a little heartwarming.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>not going out. coding a little. reading a little? &amp; sleep, 12:30. okay with it, mostly. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>about page -</div>
<div>interested in data as pursuit of truth</div>
<div>code as a way to create with logic</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sat night out. walking 1 hr - design podcast baba linked to as company. interesting actually. designing meaningful interactions, system that holds designers more accountable (sort of like in healthcare). then kelela &amp; friends.</div>
<div>at shannon’s. hi. a mostly harmless looking group. names. the game where you put phone on forehead, describe. </div>
<div>rooftop.</div>
<div>en route - talking to unc senior, aspiring musician. about his process. my dabbling.</div>
<div>‘so brooklyn’. flamboyant gay man in all white (later, pants replaced w cutoff shorts), red high heels. dancing grinding a live Facebook selfie feed. poetry, dry &amp; sometimes funny. poetry, harrowing &amp; racial. comedy - mostly stereotypical. music, folky. dance. mostly confusing. (conversation about making sense of dance afterwards..)</div>
<div>talking to - music guy from brown (name?). 2013 grad, director of music curation at a studio. an attitude of networking, confidence that bleeds into life. walking off with him + dancer to get whiskey. </div>
<div>passing bottle around</div>
<div>talking to - girl who has dance company, works for theater company &amp; does something else? wow. in dc previously. stretching convo out with her and music guy nearby</div>
<div>lover’s and friends, yet again. danz for hour, me and group of mostly girls.</div>
<div>bye, 1:20am. shannon, lena telling me i’m a good dancer? lol.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>podcasts about - myth of personality (invisibilia - reformed prisoner example). my conclusion that personality is response to change in emotional stimuli. or in some ways energy. it’s not your state but the forces that propel you to respond to a new stimulus differently. this needs more thinking.. </div>
<div>and taste (538). algorithms as a means of eliminating human bias. arbitrariness of likes and dislikes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>recurring live dream of like leaving arcadia or them not wanting me and resolving to carve my own path. should get this negativity out before returning to job.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div>5/30 - </div>
<div>getting to may’s.</div>
<div>there. a stop at duane reade -&gt; smoking. watching rick and morty. plot line getting progressively more complex, but unraveling and winding in a brilliant way. can’t remember content, just nature of progression.</div>
<div>maybe upset (just a tinge) at face that may can’t make bday? and move-in? and leaving in a bit for LA. hm. all fair choices. can’t expect her to miss an entire weekend for me..</div>
<div>sleep, early wake up.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>write to live live to write.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5/31 - </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>move in. hour journey, suitcase over turnstiles.</div>
<div>sitting on steps, seeing lena walk by, bagel in hand. carrying sunshine. chatting, unpacking.</div>
<div>a bit of work.</div>
<div>apartment dingy, dirty. room, pretty good (though a little hot). aim of summer is, mainly to work. why did i leave comfy slow boston for dirty noisy fascinating brooklyn?</div>
<div>variety coffee shop. </div>
<div>stroll &amp; home. work.</div>
<div>robin. each of us buzzing with awkward energy. things like: being reformed slacker. canadian/arab. upbringing, conservative/racist in family strain, but parents liberal. travels, traveler vs tourist. the brain. the brain. consciousness. and my neuroscience research. invitation to crazy noise rock show, missing out.</div>
<div>may over, 9 pm. cooking dinner. resources low, kitchen small. a usual ambiguous not-curry not-stir-fry deal.</div>
<div>chance echoing.</div>
<div>immersed in talk of?</div>
<div>then, walking around the neighborhood. &amp; drinks.</div>
<div>a sort of timid energy around myself, an imaginary dynamic where may is feeling responsible for introduction to hood, cheering up? something like this?</div>
<div>not standing out, or trying not to stand out. how i’m profiled.</div>
<div>thinking of myself and my brain and my scatter-brain and when i should flex my scatter-brain</div>
<div>conversation with people &amp; strangers a sort of unimaginable thing. like how it lasts long. i mean i know..but how. i should ask the penetrating questions, but they’re not too? &lt;-thought unrelated to interactions, hanging chatting with may and robin, hours each.</div>
<div>apartment smells like seto's</div>
<div>foot pain and swelling</div>
<div>brooklyn weirdly bringing out jordan</div>
<div>brutalist websites</div>
<div>saying goodbye to may - man stopping us to ask for change, and spouting absolute gibberish</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/1</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>coming = good choice. shift in mental energy.</div>
<div>morning. 6 hrs not enough, but up, up anyway. forcing food down. working for like only 1-1.5 hr, and then reading and re-reading paragraph.</div>
<div>gym. richie’s gym. enter: concrete, brutal building. no doors, just stores await. posters of upcoming fights scattered, only real decor.</div>
<div>third floor labeled, in tough, thick caps font ‘third floor’. brooklyn bro-type and latino guy running the place. clientele: almost all hispanic and black. many buff buff dudes. weights, old, rusty. but the basics there.</div>
<div>across, elevate train tracks. level.</div>
<div>this is brooklyn, can get widdit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back home, shower, cook chicken. on chair in kitchen, laptop in front, chicken sizzling. nestled, huddled, pseudo-working.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>not 2 much success w dating apps..but like one message from sort of cute risd grad</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>out to coffee shops. first: bushwick public house. one of three clients. waiter barista person, asian, delightful, confident. talking to dutch (?) transplant. then putting on action movie, watching. next to me, black girl, short hair, typing away. and people coming and going on the way. one guy familiar w dutch man, quick conversation about football. but maybe not dutch because then waiter practicing french w him? (outside: the elevate train tracks).</div>
<div>others coming in on bikes.</div>
<div>then: dweebs. small, andro barista. clientele crazy hip, bunny shoes emblematic. looking at designy things on their laptops. words exchanged: ‘oh no, these are my headphones, i think. the cord is wrapped’. all black, flip-flop wearing woman leaving to smoke cigarette outside, after meeting with timid man who asked about my headphones. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home —&gt; working. progressively more productive.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>brooklyn as the perfect unsustainable utopia really. all people interested in creative things + others who are generally cool, want to be around coolness, and will live gritty life to be part of it. amazing .. (thought is deeper than description here)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>explosions in sky song, listening to now, culminating in crazy crazy feedback-induced high-pitched crescendo. head down, taking it in. then song stopping, at once, back to writing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>do i really want to go back to work? maybe just try to move here. why arcadia, really? but arcadia: need to keep up, send message or something.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>things to see. music. things to do. talk to people.</div>
<div>(really should write in day. or when high. but not when tired)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thought catalog project a bit more concrete. thoughts floating from central semantic nodes, but all invisible. sort of floating around. then adding filters to organize. hm. how were filters more concrete? thoughts sifted in lists, perhaps?</div>
<div>how can i make this beautiful and not just structural.</div>
<div>(get loopy and start categorizing patterns)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>when you know songs too well, the feeling today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sometimes i think ‘i’m not going to forget this i’m not i’m not’ and do.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work log:</div>
<div>css layout, all day. all day. float and clear-fix. grasping. fixing my little webpage, aligning things properly. table format, other formats. relative and absolute positioning. in the brain. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>kids don’t say to adults ‘i love adults’. we’re so reductive.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>cs examples (enter text here) as a manifestation of the conscious subconscious</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>book store - molasses</div>
<div>a sign in the restroom ‘jiggle handle if still running’. casual, real. things becoming charming when everything works too well.</div>
<div>mindfulness not needed when things are in your face.</div>
<div>a chat about - poetry book related to logic. generative poetry based on images. (the programmer artist)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home. checking - coffee shops? then, no, i can stay here. 10 minutes later, still checking coffee shops - so fuck it / leave</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>food simple. this cooked and thrown on this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>bloc, breezing through checkpoints. so far not very worthwhile.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>rest of day.</div>
<div>home and home - cooking, calling nabil.</div>
<div>nabil + marriage. how he sees it as commitment, effort, work. and that’s what he loves</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then chat w kareem.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and - again. the shoe size dilemma. just. fucking. size. up?</div>
<div>wow. a 3 hour </div>
<div>talk w kareem</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>standing may up</div>
<div>at the bar</div>
<div>turtle</div>
<div>chats</div>
<div>etc etc</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/3 (birthday :o)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>calls from: stef. quite nice. mainly talking about friends from home (nabil’s marriage). how rosie is doing, and tash. marriage, cultural expectations.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on hold w bank of america. hold hold hold, card declined earlier.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a beautiful message from harsh. unlikelihood of us meeting. then: down to earth, witty, creatively talented, and arab/american. him + others thinking i’m a great individual. wow..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a continuation of destructive indecisiveness. buying shoes (8.5), fly jordan’s from shoe store near bushwick/williamsburg. can only try one shoe at a time - with grumpy shopkeeper doling out individual shoes (people run off w shoes, crazy). feeling embarrassed, unable to make decision, until worker basically like ‘just get the 8.5 man’. the 9 bending. but 8.5 too tight on fat right foot. and then home. lesson from stan smith: just size up, and get an insole if needed really. but. wanting. shoes. now. so wearing around house. googling ‘shoe sizing’. all with awareness of how stupid this is, how i’ve done the same thing multiple times..and now, settling on most likely keeping/stretching out b/c canvas?</div>
<div>just. fucking. size. up?</div>
<div>(two-sock method, it turns, worked out, and shoes really did stretch out..hm. confusing, though feeling like less of idiot)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>indecision yielding to deep tiredness, falling asleep, exchanging small talk w robin.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>earlier: working at variety. sort of productive, though course quite dry / not practical now. and no communication from mentor.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(the day, overall, drifting by. finally, resolve to get outside (walk) and casey over just shortly after..</div>
<div>manhattan? williamsburg first. rocking new shoes, feet tight, uncomfortable (should have, should have sized up), baseball-like shirt, black fancy pants. a rather sharp look i think. drink at bourguious place. crowd older, polished. walking, wandering, then - lower east side. scanning streets, few times. </div>
<div>(patchi bailing on bar meet up)</div>
<div>guy named derrick sending us business card promising open bar in hotel. hit a few places, semi-dance/drink, then, like 1am, hotel chantelle. </div>
<div>a long line, skeptical that card will work. bouncer smiles, lets us in.</div>
<div>and derrik, in corner, pouring drinks. birthday, it turns out. 36. many other strangers there? confusing, interesting, situation overall. some swaying before making way back home.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>don’t expect don’t expect in depth calls for bday. friends mostly forgetting, that’s normal natural and i do the same. though the people who do remember, give half-hearted: yo happy bday, like maliha = hm guess we’ve drifted? a message from jade at night, saying - let’s hang out sometime this summer, no worries about drunken night. birthday feelings a recurrence, it seems.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back home ready sleep</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/4</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10:40ish shower up out to park slope - alex rapport’s. (and also, dan, evan)</div>
<div>beautiful, utopian park slope. and tasteful, young intellectual apartment. the structure: sunlight, exposed brick, fresh wooden floors, walls with pre-built character. and furnishment: red table, bright chairs. books books trinkets. should really craigslist harder, thinking..</div>
<div>hi hi to alex what have you been up to. dan in kitchen, preparing waffles. evan rising, following waffle waft shortly after.</div>
<div>diner. vitality, wakefulness w food and coffee. lena alex casey. paralegal life, while waiting for lena. last nights. a happy belated birthday - and casey’s realization that it was my birthday. then lena. gig painting for someone with parkinson’s. &amp; &amp; ..</div>
<div>back to alex’s. chatting to dan about freelance photography life, luring everyone to come to prospect park.</div>
<div>prospect park. around us, mixed crowd, older than bushwick. on blanket, semi-sunny spot, evan playing kaytranada. direct view, bikers struggling to make it up hill. beers, conversation, sun soaking. and frisbee with wesleyan 27 yr old bros.</div>
<div>retreating, sweaty.</div>
<div>a present, flowing not thinking all that much sort of state of mind.</div>
<div>recharge: shower, espresso shot</div>
<div>brooklyn museum first saturday.</div>
<div>inside, family-friendly bumpin. everyone dancing. things like: rihanna/work with heavier drums. beautiful scene, varied economic class it looks, super mixed. outside &amp; projections. writing down thoughts on gentrification - though like are these white people not gentrifiers? or is this primarily on landlord? lena’s gf, shannon, beautiful, engaging, strong eye contact, and happy birthday upon meeting. oh wow amazing hi nice to meet you. and friends: one working at warby parker, and gf who recently quit job.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>saving topics of conversation. a weird thing. do others do this? big things like love/dating</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>life here different pace here different thought pattern different..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>gentrification = the topic. problem = capitalism rewarding money, landlords charging more and more. gov should either reimburse rent differences or force rent control. cool white artsy people who can’t afford nice housing move and hip-ify area -&gt; area = cooler, others w more money attracted -&gt; rent increasing -&gt; residents leaving. needs macro level control, since the money that comes late in gentrification (primarily from businesspeople working away from area that they are gentrifying) doesn’t go directly to gov (and therefore cannot be fed into rent control). instead to companies, outside towns. and money not to local businesses, but new fresh businesses.</div>
<div>my musings, thoughts.</div>
<div>gentrification in some ways inevitable, but need to be mindful, avoid eating at the super hip, support local restaurants and run-down stores.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>post museum, staring at fountain.</div>
<div>burger. dan like - i’m really glad you’re here. caught off guard with noticement, niceness.</div>
<div>bars in crown heights. first, soul night at mostly hip clean place. music a bit too low-key, but a few jamming hard. leaving in search of more bass.</div>
<div>picking up lost ring + rewarded with instant make-out. and later, rejection.</div>
<div>dance dance</div>
<div>patchi &amp; hate for ny, long distance relationship, past few weeks in the city.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>franklin park, the bar. a sort of truce ground. gentrifiers, local community there. an even within locals: spectrum. some people </div>

<div>when the environment is the focus:</div>

<div>forgetting about life. the elements of life that constitute continuity. family.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>down about love. low tinder / bumble / real life success. hit gym hard, feel better + more secure?</div>

<div>walking may to the train station in circular route. this neighborhood. the almost orchestrated grit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the bushwhack hipsters and yearning for an earlier fictional nostalgic age</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>smoking robin’s ‘awake’ weed</div>

<div>hm thought / background noise not seeming legitimate. journal as a source of data?</div>

<div>portfolio project classifications </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the usual thought of fluid personality resonating after an article of similar opinion</div>

<div>refreshed &amp; born - but not sure why</div>
<div>day feeling - stifled. unsure where to work.</div>
<div>first tour at co-working spaces. one like okay but really 25/day?</div>
<div>and then air jordan 1 i couldn’t return b/c tried on too hard (really) hurting feet and feet hurt and i have made no progress in that front</div>
<div>(sat morning = shopping !) or thurs or some other day</div>
<div>but working spaces not working so nearby cafe instead, twin peaks themed. aka few twin peaks posters.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>20-25 min walk from myrtle-wychoff but people different. less grunge hipster (though present present). odd business-men or old ladies saying dear. williamsburg-looking older people. white. guy wearing raggedy clothing, talking about some sort of manual labor? portugese girl near me mixing languages elegantly. guy and woman, not dating (most likely). guy devouring devouring bagel. not just hungry or eating fast. but focused. looking at bagel. choosing the right posture/stance to maximize bite. other woman joining after. little comments made, many with bagel in mouth. focused on people </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>self-esteem maybe going up with few more tinder matches (really) &amp; realizing bumble has weird ranking system that throws people who either 1) don’t respond or 2) mass swipe (me) to bottom of pile. hmkay.</div>
<div>how to start conversations, now..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back to dweeb’s. the spot. energy level perfect. nearby, semi-flamboyant tall blonde in tank + black hair black black + denim tats u know the type talking about ‘shows’. dude organizing burlesque shows? hm. clients. dancers &amp; descriptions, amid bloc.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>continuing w/ bloc jams. jQuery refactor. useful tidbit of day: setting function as listener - w parameters - without calling function. basically .click(function() {function w params}) type of thing. seeing that foundation is helping me shortcut through some things i would have googled over and over, props will help me structure apps more quickly. trouble following directions though, program working but diverging from bloc’s. (play-pause-next functionality in bloc-jams..)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>music cafe hipster grunge 2 much in head</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home. laundry. mexican music blasting (blasting everywhere really..whizzing through my head, further disorienting).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>getting high last night helping me realize realize really where i am. like looking around brooklyn wow zah.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>—being refreshed. on that. laundry. drying cycle: disappearing into article about school segregation. ny incredibly segregated, little policy trying to fight this. but anyway. heat from drying machines. phone screen. physical sensations. but rapt in article. then home and - music. oo ah relaxing music not from cafes chosen by me. dj koze. laundry away, impromptu room reshuffling (hey this nice can work here). food. really standard mundane but needed - space - music - ability to reflect - to feel good.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5/11 (sat)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>11am up, slight hangover </div>
<div>Making toast</div>
<div>Complex toast, Sabrina calls it. Burnt (yes, intentionally) cinnamon; peanut butter, banana.</div>
<div>Sabrina up.</div>
<div>Naked and in bed. Cuddling, listening to: a fan-induced squeak. Poster rattling on walk. Sounding like: starving kitten. Sounds from street shuffling in. Hispanic music, conversation, birds. Cries. Things.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Checking time: 3:30. Oh shit. A tiger shirt (complement) &amp; preparations to leave. Breakfast at: dweebs. There the conversation like: friends smart and friends theses and some really shitty instagram experimental theses. Sabrina: rhetorical analysis of language used by peta, similarity to civil rights movement. Me: not zapping monkeys. Talking to strangers. &amp;&amp;</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Back home: finding a tootsie pop on desk. Emptied from pockets. Indicator of: memory loss. Or nature of it. Because when sober, you expect to forget many trivial things (when you went to bathroom for ex) - but not forget how tootsie pop was lost. What's feeding perception of memory </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/12</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Morning hi robin and friends then gym</div>
<div>Working at kave. Coffee shop nestled in small hip complex. </div>
<div>Delving into 1 hour convo with two native Manhattan parents. Prompted by: 'you, what do you do for a living?'. As in, why are you working at this coffee shop?  Explaining explaining listening. Women: makes puppets now. Used to be audio engineer for brain eno. Worked at bank, did other things. Now tho, puppets and newspaper clippings. Husband, fitness trainer (shows). (Recalling a women's envy: 'you just do what you want')</div>
<div>Yay conversations with strangers</div>
<div>Like I'm opening up </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Stopping by robin's bike shop. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Boiler room. Well shmancy dinner w may, Greenpoint. Looking like Park Slope.</div>
<div>Following experimental edm bro, guy with turntable tatted playing abrasive beats. Getting places with experiment tho, and eventually bringing on flamboyant passionate rapper. </div>
<div>Show begins.</div>
<div>Dance 4 hours</div>
<div>Hi Ryan Glassman</div>
<div>Hi Emma's friends</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/13 </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Portfolio design.</div>
<div>Meeting may at dweeb's and ah I can't take this. Until 5:30. </div>
<div>Then more.</div>
<div>Combo of: sketch designs, physical sketch, scattered notes, and portfolio oogling.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At night: browsing pretty vertical scrolly portfolio's that take user through linear narrative. And like: is this just better?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Too many design thoughts in bed </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/14</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Portfolio design continuing. </div>
<div>At the moment; no longer hating 3D diagonal card arrangement. Could be a unique site. </div>
<div>Cobalt blue font, fold out pages </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Through Brownsville </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Running to L train in Brownsville, knocking blind lady's cane. In a blur, flylo playing through, apologies sprouting </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Crown heights</div>
<div>Sharon's place - for July / $580 a month. Clean nice near museum. Wide street. Orthodox Jews </div>
<div>The word: thickly settled.</div>
<div>to the left, black people to right.</div>
<div>Dominican food in crowded mini restaurant. Asking man, 'what to order?'</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/15 and 6/16</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Morning spirit lifted a bit as design is affirmed for website. Designing about page, content, then semi working w Jekyll. </div>
<div>Nap then to </div>
<div>Mays</div>
<div>2 full express trains, missing. Noting graphic design of signs.</div>
<div>College kids in</div>
<div>A sort of half greeting from the girls. Marshall and Grif super friendly. Also incidentally tripping.</div>
<div>Milling about and wondering where to put my body.</div>
<div>Waiting waiting stalled by joints </div>
<div>Then out the door</div>
<div>Trains</div>
<div>Feeling long</div>
<div>At prospect park a beautiful beautiful day </div>
<div>Debating tripping and deciding no </div>
<div>Inside the park venue</div>
<div>Worrying about tickets then finding a place to sit, smoke. Getting instantly high (Popsicle taste intensifying as evidence) and deciding: half a tab.</div>
<div>Eventually crowd wandering, separated behind may Amanda by tall dude. Near the becky's little bro who just finished high school. </div>
<div>An opening band that the crowd liked but was somewhat irritating. French. Layers not melding. Glad I have taste still on acid.</div>
<div>Crowd paranoia. Is everyone looking at me, laughing at me? Talking about me? Knowing that can't be true but it feels like it..</div>
<div>Tame impala finally on.</div>
<div>At first currents I think.</div>
<div>Thinking: damn they got some beats. Really. And getting down.</div>
<div>Mind mischief </div>
<div>Beginning to 'confront' issues: </div>
<div>Sharing a ridiculous thought and may like shaking head. And then feeling stupid. I shouldn't feel bad. This is okay. A sort of feigned lucidity?</div>
<div>Sensitive to: may's acknowledgement of me. Things I say, how others perceive me.</div>
<div> like everyone is watching laughing talking about me. I know it's not real but seeing it happen, subtly. </div>
<div>Getting down to: why won't she talk to me? Others too. Lyrics so drawn out and just swaying singing to me.</div>
<div>Brain wandering in?</div>
<div>Weird animations</div>
<div>This beautiful beautiful young looking but I think my age girl. Face perfect.</div>
<div>Again - try to talk to may. I l think share something funny? Or trivial but like a hey here's a piece of my brain. Shot down. May looking at crooked hat. Confiscating, and not asking about anything else.</div>
<div>Hm okay.</div>
<div>How I can sort of imagine interactions w people.</div>
<div>Not really feeling warmth. From this crew. hm.</div>
<div>Maybe trip was normal? but at some point, exploring every open crevice in brain.</div>
<div>May wanting to head outside crowd. So much a part of music right now I'm not even listening to it. So yes.</div>
<div>Outside. Alternatingly sitting and standing. Enjoying music at both paces. Feeling air. And pulled in.</div>
<div>The concert actually really great. not wanting to end. Feels like we only go backwards.</div>
<div>Really sort of contemplating tame impala lyrics. Or for certain songs where mind went all over the place. Like is this song. That's amazing if it allowed my mind to wander like that..</div>
<div>But thinking</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Leaving concert to go to Hope's car. Straightedge. In a sort of wasteland in the city? Cars, only.</div>
<div>Then, in park slope. Recognizing area.</div>
<div>Figuring out trains, eventually.</div>
<div>The Q home comfortable but feeling like I'm pulling body together.</div>
<div>Listening to: now and for next few hours, camp talk.</div>
<div>Falafel guys. Egyptian guy practicing English and joking. Asking 'where you from?' To clearly white American girl.</div>
<div>Body </div>
<div>The same intense urge to pull skin out.</div>
<div>Waiting for bed.</div>
<div>W may, fidgeting so much it drives her to couch.</div>
<div>Notice this, in the morning. And feeling bad regretful my brain was fine fine should I always welcome disruption like this?</div>
<div>Clenching </div>
<div>Feeling face bone structure </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/16 morning </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A bit defeated. In a nothing can satisfy mood. Walking on street and pace is odd, noticing and zooming on people.  </div>
<div>A bit better as I write about trip</div>
<div>Wasn't like bad</div>
<div>Just mentally exhausting.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/18</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today like</div>
<div>revisiting post acid weirdness</div>
<div>and reading journal</div>
<div>and just hming more</div>
<div>at maria hernandez park</div>
<div>wondering if i can play ball</div>
<div>decide: best not to play if i need to pee and there is no bathroom and i may have to leave for a bathroom</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and thinking: i have nothing to write about what am i?</div>
<div>but no - have things to write about</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>smoking with robin and talking bike shop. and vancouver.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>compulsive phone checking</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>website design. shows up, resizes proportionally. now to build three more layouts. </div>
<div>responsive design and grid contemplations</div>
<div>css</div>
<div>html</div>
<div>in my head</div>
<div>coding do i like it okay i like it the front-end stuff at least.</div>
<div>what am i doing again? data science? maybe just designer coder. do i need data too? yea i suppose, full satisfaction</div>
<div>work for data viz agency = the dream</div>
<div>saying the obvious</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>waiting for may</div>
<div>getting into bk ~12:30 doing it late nye style</div>
<div>realizing: not that much time chilling with may in ny.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today: a bit lonely/confining. hence walk. but productive with jekyll/html -&gt; js migration of layout generation. from the csv u know.</div>
<div>can grid layout have separate media queries?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>post acid ~~~weirdness.</div>
<div>was this a bad trip?</div>
<div>don’t think so</div>
<div>just overwhelming but sort of good at tame impala</div>
<div>and just restless and sort of not good after</div>
<div>and morning after</div>
<div>blerghling all over the place</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ideas for interactive code writing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>brain all over the place but in productive direction.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the smell in new dorm</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>When u set your own precedent </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Leaving an unnamed tension open in your brain</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6.21</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Working on interaction all day</div>
<div>Brain feeling hazy</div>
<div>Nap, second awakening, finally interaction detected </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Apartment emptied</div>
<div>Conversation about baseball nearby </div>
<div>At patchi's bday</div>
<div>Talking mostly to Eliza</div>
<div>About intelligence, bridgewater, yearly review, emotional fluctuation &amp; it's causes / overlaying optimism and driving to towards good or away from bad. Siavash. Whispering dome.</div>
<div>Sami's cousin cute art therapist</div>
<div>Being in the city &amp; ceasing to exist </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/24</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>things that have happened lately-</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>fasting, just one day tried. cloudiness outside contributing perhaps, but tired, irritable. coffee please? </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking of tinder tag. now ‘okay with confusion’. starting with quirks, values, and sorting of getting somewhere, but nothing catchy, funny, compelling. thinking of juxtaposing ‘an alternate life (weird silly dream of self’ with ‘current life (what i like to do)’. alternate life: object? owl? i don’t know. lego man? cartoon character. some sort of inanimate object.</div>
<div>swiping like it’s a chore - need grlz</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>co-working space. quiet mostly productive sometimes insular. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>smoking w robin. going off on tangents about web development. creating things with pure logic, obsessiveness.</div>
<div>web dev: creating things with pure logic, obsessiveness. love/hate, but mostly mostly good for me and suited to my brain.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>post bridgewater: thinking about brain tendencies and - would love to more concretely know what they are. previously: contradicted with idea of fluid self + could not take criticism, or realize limits. but now, ready, would like to figure out career + path.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>talking to ~me too much lately. sometimes catching self breaking out into small gestures.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>podcasts. most recently: american life about being fat. sam harris (eliza’s recommendation) on drugs as potential tool for mindfulness. specifically: show that altered conscious is possible can motivate meditation? okay sure, me a skeptic but not in that regard. invisibilia about: social norms. mcdonald’s in russia + american fake smiles (expectation for happiness in service industry). 99% invisible - sweden switching from right to left side of driving (beautiful).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in the news: brexit, really?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at night - trouble sleeping because thinking about code. always the potential thought of: okay - what do i do next. how can i structure the next piece?</div>
<div>do i like coding? (me think so)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>headspace liike</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>website in the website living in the website. interactivity mainly working - time-grid filter etc etc. need to just re-structure css.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/26 (weekend)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>laptop near me, saying ‘I SUPPORT THE WAR ON AMERICA BY BATH SALTS'</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>haircut. strolling the neighborhood, options surprisingly narrow.</div>
<div>sitting, unacknowledged in barbershop w/ just one barber. 3 customers. taking time. so bouncing and.</div>
<div>similar deal - one barber, but one customer. </div>
<div>my turn. no acknowledgement after telling him how i would like hair. i like the length on top, i say. most of the haircut sideways. 30 min later, hair gone. a strange symmetrical cut with a little side swipe. accentuating long face. a confined frustration. hats.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>better description - haircut, confined frustration, hats </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>saturday morning shopping in manhattan. nike store first. a spectacle. walking away with size 9 huaraches, conflicted with that and size up - though both really too narrow for feet. option to return. shoes fly as hell, lamenting the ongoing quest to continue to find comfy dope shoes. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>new york attention span lower than in boston. not listening to full songs or albums. shuffling, flipping through. or, step back, not just sitting on subway. compelled to get: extra stimulation of music, even through headphones (w/ layers n layers filtered out).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>balling in the neighborhood (5 min into run, enticed by ball)</div>
<div>then: long chat with michael. about: leaving job / what i’ve been up to / solidified ambitions. brooklyn &amp; what’s like. travel plans. trip to saudi, door’s engagement. mike’s relationship (good, though less time w friends), mental health, plans to do molly. making dinner, eating, and conversation transitioning from agenda to just - chilling. talking about little things and observations. nice and a little heartwarming.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>not going out. coding a little. reading a little? &amp; sleep, 12:30. okay with it, mostly. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>about page -</div>
<div>interested in data as pursuit of truth</div>
<div>code as a way to create with logic</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sat night out. walking 1 hr - design podcast baba linked to as company. interesting actually. designing meaningful interactions, system that holds designers more accountable (sort of like in healthcare). then kelela &amp; friends.</div>
<div>at shannon’s. hi. a mostly harmless looking group. names. the game where you put phone on forehead, describe. </div>
<div>rooftop.</div>
<div>en route - talking to unc senior, aspiring musician. about his process. my dabbling.</div>
<div>‘so brooklyn’. flamboyant gay man in all white (later, pants replaced w cutoff shorts), red high heels. dancing grinding a live Facebook selfie feed. poetry, dry &amp; sometimes funny. poetry, harrowing &amp; racial. comedy - mostly stereotypical. music, folky. dance. mostly confusing. (conversation about making sense of dance afterwards..)</div>
<div>talking to - music guy from brown (name?). 2013 grad, director of music curation at a studio. an attitude of networking, confidence that bleeds into life. walking off with him + dancer to get whiskey. </div>
<div>passing bottle around</div>
<div>talking to - girl who has dance company, works for theater company &amp; does something else? wow. in dc previously. stretching convo out with her and music guy nearby</div>
<div>lover’s and friends, yet again. danz for hour, me and group of mostly girls.</div>
<div>bye, 1:20am. shannon, lena telling me i’m a good dancer? lol.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>podcasts about - myth of personality (invisibilia - reformed prisoner example). my conclusion that personality is response to change in emotional stimuli. or in some ways energy. it’s not your state but the forces that propel you to respond to a new stimulus differently. this needs more thinking.. </div>
<div>and taste (538). algorithms as a means of eliminating human bias. arbitrariness of likes and dislikes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>recurring live dream of like leaving arcadia or them not wanting me and resolving to carve my own path. should get this negativity out before returning to job.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/30</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>waking up. having slept. no crashes noises yells. just, up.</div>
<div>and - a tinder message from 28 yr old saying - ‘you’re too young for me but thought you were cute'</div>
<div>okay. a virtual persona confidence boost.</div>
<div>today, fasting. resolve to: go to taraweeh later</div>
<div>working at father knows best, outdoors</div>
<div>digable planets carrying me through walk. caterpillar monologue.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6/29 &amp; this week really (retro from 6/30)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lots of wrist pain</div>
<div>taking breaks before i burn out. result: feel lazy, but constantly fresh, ready to work.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work:</div>
<div>mon/tue css interactions. just a few really, but transitions on: content fading in, buttons popping out, opacity changing, resizes, about page sliding down. happy with landing page, evoking the aesthetic i wanted (and quite quite different from lust.nl). about page interactive timeline taking most of tuesday, trying to get the resize perfect without too many breakpoints.</div>
<div>wed: content page. iterating iterating. looking at fonts, websites. making a standard two column layout (thinking of having slider for image &lt;-&gt; txt sizing). but just..didn’t look pretty. so now, one column, little boxes for each section. maybe progress button.</div>
<div>how will i add new projects / categories? hm.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>7/1</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>to some extent a writing emotional paralysis where barrier is need for ~originality whatever the fuck that it (=cryptic thoughts and writing pseudo depth) </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>studying head frequently. how can i mitigate length of face?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in morning carrying resentment to may? texting wanna get dinner tonight - and ‘nah mama’s bday, maybe sunday’? bday understandable but inferring maybe not hanging out until then? given infrequency of hanging already. feeling like an afterthought. (but get rid of this - may has more friends i’m just one person not that person etc)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in shower how clean can i get before water level rises above ankle?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>brooklyn paying to the highs and lows ebbs and lows</div>
<div>music carrying me again</div>
<div>could maybe use meditation now. distraction. not truly absorbing feeling. or maybe just need more frequent</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>most of time developing website really just refreshing and maybe slightly changing property. taking kevin’s suggestion: work first in greyscale. 30 min trying to make plus sign with divs but always just slightly off. &amp;&amp; some lazy coding, not really feeling re-factoring, writing super efficient tight code.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>progress in liking self, body?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today not fasting.</div>
<div>slow breakfast &amp; meeting with kevin. as usual, just going by showing website..not really asking </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>content portfolio page mainly done. underwhelming but just content is underwhelming.</div>
<div>sometimes thinking maybe i should buy cigarettes </div>
<div>sometimes thinking maybe i should not cook and just buy mexican food</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>not everything has to be deep</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>7/2</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the current situation</div>
<div>father knows best (productivity in the am, promiscuity in the pm). wooden backyard. a large (very) dog, suspended light bulbs, rectangles, mural (cosmic community). in ears, japanese breakfast —</div>
<div>floaty rock (okay non rap cool too) all morning - melody’s echo chamber, upon waking. swooning to layered, intricate sounds, different in each ear. existing in the music, primarily, and analysis, lyrical attention lagging. a sort of dark morning. beautiful sunny perfect weather but loneliness pessimism. rolling around, 30 min or so, tired, not sleeping and just thinking of me me and where are friends.  lingering from last night - meeting people i don’t ‘relate’ to. self-medication: run (despite aching knees). so run, towards ridge wood (queens). landscape different (white people, for one, cleanliness for two). resolve - early on run, to erase this thought of ‘may doesn’t care doesn’t care doesn’t hang with me’ b/c legitimate reasons not to. (though maybe doing nails instead of helping me move questionable - rest = reunions trips and scheduled things). mental cleansing ~sort of working. some resentment to may, but absorbing music, day sun and more clear-headed.</div>
<div>(good lord dog is enormous literally human size no bigger why is this creature in the city)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>mind floating. here in cafe. a reply from may ‘not free, high school reunion’ triggering (&lt;-). flips to website, on desktop, mobile. ticket prices. airbnb. whatsapp to: daryl = bday, mama = itinerary, apology for booking such short trip. texts to robin. Facebook flip, once or twice. (photo of yamak, smiling in makkah w/ caption ‘our faces when we heard there’s albaik next to mosque’. for a short moment, contemplating imagining life. the beauty of Facebook - not the depth or meaning of statuses. but, the short moments where you can imagine another life. or - just imagine the moment this person was writing status. this, more realistic, a small slice of another brain. how long to book trip? how long how long? counting days on finger. airbnb search again then wait i don’t even know this area. shuffling through the cafe - moms &amp; friends, a few local brooklynites. moms &amp; co. mainly. watching giant bug. moving like stop motion animation. there are thoughts there are thoughts. the cups here, a blue outline on the rim, white otherwise. thoughts of - graphic design. do i like that can i do that? the data + datavis prob more meaningful /suited to me than dev + design. conversation with stef on phone. all these..moments i’ve had here. like say - conv with david, night w sabrina, rooftop party, acid trip, general walking around neighborhood. moments. but the sum ending in a ‘been working on this and it’s new and interesting’. the sum and the parts. sum here, much different from parts. in reality, an up and down, somewhat emotionally turbulent - alternate emotionally numb - exploration of self personality myself self conscious my confidence self tendency. boston. the other life. adam vash. coding for good. get good at coding, need to need to. get those skills.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>re-playing conversation with capital a anarchist (david) from last night. a bit too lenient on him. gently directing to flaws in lifestyle, trying to understand motivations behind solid concrete yet incoherent world view. but, given second chance, would have challenged harder. philosophies (bullets b/c coherence difficult to glean). starting with conversation about cargo bikes -&gt; david talking about the bike collective he’s in -&gt; spouting entire philosophy with little prompting.</div>
<div>+ i am privileged and grew up privileged and i’m able to push boundaries (i.e. not pay rent squat steal from corporate things scam)  so i should push the boundaries so that others can? i know this is unfair, but the world is unfair (new tirade). issue: him pushing boundaries does not (necessarily) make it easier for others to push boundaries. system will simply tighten its boundaries, and the few others that don’t have privilege and are exploiting the system will be punished. </div>
<div>+ a ground-up ‘i do what feels right’ approach. or ‘i try to do what makes others feel good’. if others came up to me and told me, for ex, that distributing food to poor people made them feel shitty, weird (why u white people think u angels type thing) then i wouldn’t do it. but - assumption that: others will in fact articulate grievances. and that </div>
<div>+ a worldview that - maybe maybe would work if everyone else was the same way. if everyone else had the same exact view. (though tenuous still). inconsiderate, idealistic, and naive.</div>
<div>+ an unrelenting fuck the cops - or, more broadly, an unrelenting of idea of who is and who isn’t the system. = a reductive, cursory look into what forces are authoritative and oppressive. </div>
<div>+ bike collective &amp; shared labor here. let’s say - a bike app where programmers and delivery people are payed the same. pointing out that delivery people are far more replaceable and actually doing a ‘hm, that’s interesting’. really, not obvious? (this, less of a problem morally).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>+ silly example of how stolen beer encourages sharing but purchased beer does not. so like fuck capitalism.</div>
<div>+ a capitalization on anger. what are you doing to do with anger?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>+ incredibly concrete beliefs, yet: hiding behind the veil of nihilism because it removes accountability. nothing matters so i do what i want. this really is the core, and, if it was the only belief, with all other ideologies thrown out, would be </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>= a selfish lifestyle. living off crevices in the system that he doesn’t need - that other, less privileged people would be less benefited from. (this assuming that crevices are limited, that they aren’t being widened by activity). and taking from others, friends who are working in system. but even if exploiting system is destroying it: at what cost and to whom? the problem is - anarchism is not a real view, and cannot replace a system. you can only be an anarchist if there is a system. if there are apartments to squat, people working jobs to mooch off. if everyone was an anarchist, the world would not subsist. collectivism, communism here more logical. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>clearly giving too much credence, thought into this. though: exercise in understanding people develop identities and beliefs.</div>
<div>a stereotype a walking living stereotype how do you not see yourself as a stereotype?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>7/5</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>as of lately</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday jul 4</div>
<div>in the morning working</div>
<div>unproductively reluctantly</div>
<div>around 2, start walking to prospect park. 1.5 hour. going by relatively quickly, blood orange most of the way. a bit too chill.</div>
<div>brain state craving: instant gratification, distraction. checking: outlook, times, email, facebook, insta multiple times/day.</div>
<div>looking at this beach house album cover like what’s that</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>recurring unfolding growing encompassing thought:</div>
<div>may doesn’t want to hang out with me. with space between texts, filling in detailed story of her being sick of me. not wanting to include me. maybe i’m not socially fit. sure of this when: following ‘how are you spending day?’ text, may says she’s in bushwick (did not tell), then simply doesn’t reply to message about fireworks.</div>
<div>turns out: just busy. phone died.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today: debating if i should see may on the way there. already returning shoes to niketown. sending message about how i spent july 4th, incl. bit about tanya. and may focuses on this, does not acknowledge the ‘hey i’m leaving for a week’ bit. reminding me of acid trip, focusing on crookedness on hat (flaw) but ignoring point (that i tried to talk to her). focusing focusing on this, but deciding to text anyway. b/c: that’s the person i want to be. </div>
<div>meet up.</div>
<div>and it’s all good. may busy, happy to see me. catching up on LA trip, past weekends.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>as of lately a call with meral lasting an hour or so. part of it: intellectualizing sports &amp; social currency.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back to yesterday.</div>
<div>in prospect park. waiting finding tanya. not finding evan + co (seeking out lena, thinking she was with crew). reaching anna’s. no one there yet. but incredibly quaint, interest-worthy. new food vocabulary words type of vibe. chilling for hour, then then back to park.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>dark this time. but observing chatting for hour-ish with tanya. </div>
<div>then shawarmas. some high school reminiscing.</div>
<div>easy conversation.</div>
<div>rain.</div>
<div>scurry to train.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>watching fireworks from M station. closest thing to a rooftop. descending, entering woodbine, and new firework show developing.</div>
<div>sex with the one condom. pretty quick. fun. tanya hot as i remember.</div>
<div>leaving for: boobie trap. then hook up, shower. sex again? ah too tired.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>morning - cuddling. sleep deprived. strawberry in bed. sort of liking liking tanya.</div>
<div>then bye, 7am. packing. indecisiveness as usual.</div>
<div>working out of coffee shop but feeling weird w overcaffeination sleep deprivation.</div>
<div>so: home and pseudo nap, then just like leave for manhattan.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(beach house, as usual, whole train ride)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(earlier this weekend)</div>
<div>going out w sabrina evan co</div>
<div>pregame. poppin. dance videos. actually getting down.</div>
<div>making out w sabrina of course</div>
<div>dancing of course</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>7/13</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>drifting through. life. slightly disoriented.</div>
<div>~ a lil while</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a sound: ilovemakonnen. a three-step beep, gentle, conversational almost. kids yelling, whistles.</div>
<div>body: itches. the vague thought of bed bugs creeping in subconscious. robin</div>
<div>a feeling of - self-destruction. mildly. but it’s not working b/c mental state is relatively stable persistent. like hey maybe i’m bored of sex or weird and asexual and something wrong w me. then sex with tanya, over and over.</div>
<div>w/ tanya</div>
<div>spending: sunday night. monday day.</div>
<div>parting words: hey we’ve grown up but haven’t diverged. you’re still cool. tanya to me: you’ve developed distinct style, taste, still smart. sort of mashing together an approval of how i’ve grown. bye, with a kiss on the cheek.</div>
<div>and, sort of long face comfortable. </div>
<div>tanya = great body</div>
<div>leaving monday morning, but returning, joining me at cafe while i work. then home for quick. relationship-y.</div>
<div>previous night. just sex, cuddling really.. meeting at night, coming home, then going out to get condom - and, back..</div>
<div>comfortable.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>checking moment (phone tracking) app. on phone *a lot*. about 1 hour / day. 50 pickups roughly. many statuses to check - outlook, snap, Facebook, insta, news. bad habits.</div>
<div>and now: pokemon go too. the phenomenon. in union square last night, sizable portion of population hunting.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>bought air force flyknit in dallas. size clear then, but now feeling, too large. the most objective evidence of my indecisiveness.</div>
<div>realizing that: decision making hindering coding. once decision made, bam bam through code. but stalling. refreshing, changing fonts and colors and tweaking this that in the meantime.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(detour to go daddy - figuring out domain name..)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>previously, 7/6 - 7/10</div>
<div>en dallas</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sticking: final conversation with baba. clothing critique, first. conflicting urges to conform - like sure whatever i can wear the clothes you want - but like no fuck that clothing is personal it’s on my body i can’t compromise and you just have to open up. (conflict resolved really..) the joggers. pass a boundary. set rules. you can go so far, and i’m going too far. then a ‘would you jump off bridge’ type argument applied to trends. late, summer, yousuf, shayma in nearby room playing munchkins. itching to join, slightly guilty.</div>
<div>and then: a more valid critique of work ethic. questioning move to new york. 10 hours/day not enough. shock at casey coming for 3 days (if weekend off is surprising..). and how i’m behind, need to carve out career quickly. really. agreeing. minus the slight caveat of baba too fixated on work in overall life meaning (cannot comprehend frivolous, but ‘meaningful' impulsive decisions), still chipping away at work with family take 2. minus this - really valid. and life. yea. you’re right. okay.</div>
<div>really only - made website in this time off. now working on hospital visualization. but that’s it? really. nick can pump out visuals in same time while still working.</div>
<div>~coupling with podcast about ‘frames of reference’ (invisibilia). lady with asperges’s who, with TMS can suddenly understand emotional nuances (for 30 min). pakistani american whose issues w race, bullying, were trivial to parents. hassan minhaj. believes that father’s frame of references is..better.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>mama’s opinions. shayma relaying, lightheartedly that i’m manipulative b/c i hid girlfriend back in the day. and like ‘every arab american does this’. but word manipulative sticking w me. and then - disappointment and temp new york move, heard from baba.</div>
<div>talking to may about - aramco, family yesterday. describing mama’s fantasies of getting trailer, moving away from family. after we took moment to think - damn, 25 years (parents) of marriage is so long. may likening mama’s dark weirdness to me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>other things. noor’s apartment. swanky. the zone of - work to work and just be comfortable.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(the constant diary conflict - should i narrate things that are obvious (like noor’s apartment layout) for future omar..opting not to, instead: extrapolate. narrating the obvious = moving from journal as exploration to journal as documentation. though def heavy documentation in here..(hey who said that?))</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>but things things other things because this how i’m thinking: dallas, things?</div>
<div>an asian dinner. we don’t usually have asian dinners.</div>
<div>shayma’s house. lonely undertones. old furniture, southern feel. bright lights, cats.</div>
<div>before bed: listening to badbadnotgood. on the floor, room dark, dozing.</div>
<div>summer + yousuf</div>
<div>the usual, was not nice, playful enough, regrets</div>
<div>a grumpy munchkin really</div>
<div>but the last moments, playing munchkin, that charade on forehead game. erupting, all of us (kids, me, shayma) in laughter.</div>
<div>at the playground on highway. manicured semicircle of grass. a rope structure. climbing, chilling, selfie. </div>
<div>and</div>
<div>eid day. medieval times. poorly done, though an improbable proposal (after ridiculing idea of proposing here..). too many introductions, repetition.</div>
<div>two unhealthy meals a day, and mid-day let yourself go sweet and salty balance ever shifting, just light innocuous enough looking that you can munch repeat forever</div>
<div>eid day and justin picking me up at airport. light conversation, coffee in hand.  </div>
<div>needing: extra coffee, sleep when with family. this week: comparatively, less sleep, less coffee, but awake and kicking. hm.</div>
<div>the natural history museum but mostly a kid’s museum. strolling. one lab experiment, trying to get summer and yousuf to evenly contribute. focused, both of them..</div>
<div>though at brunch, day before leaving. downtown area. summer staring at tv, unable to sustain conversation. gr. chatting to yousuf instead, most of meal. </div>
<div>food the thing food is a thing think of food now i think of food</div>
<div>after park: mall. mama regretful at some point, suddenly ‘we shouldn’t shop’. the ups and downs..(usually, yearning for material goods). getting shoes. banana republic debacle about chino fit.</div>
<div>home, dinner. pack, laundry, baba’s talk. munchkins with munchkins, and - brief sleep on the couch.</div>
<div>mama awaking next morning, in zombie haze, making me a sandwich.</div>
<div>the usual conflict. the last token given: food. always visceral, physical when accepting. a one-way sort of love, effort. unreciprocal. </div>
<div>earlier - a brief trip to mall.</div>
<div>friday was jum'a mostly. then shayma’s later. brief outing with kids, summer not very eager until playing that frat game, throwing sack in hole. then summer chill. needs focused, competitive activity.</div>
<div>chuck e cheese with sahib and co. smaller, less impressive than pictured.</div>
<div>baba &amp; monitor shopping. scratches, highlighted, photographed on paint, and mailed back. then: resolve to go to costco next day for deal. and like: is that really important? how sights are arbitrarily set on one thing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>is somerville (better for my mental state)? is there too much to engage with here. calmer area of brooklyn ideal..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hearing ‘hey omar’ from outside window. imagination? </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at the co-working space..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>secret life of pets with may last night. &amp; night spent at hers. catching pokemon outside, then, toke, blood orange, and bed.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>7/16 (sat)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday -</div>
<div>a call from stef</div>
<div>leaving call thinking - talked to myself too much</div>
<div>thinking - that took a lot of time</div>
<div>outside, difficult to hear. an hour of background noise mashed with talk</div>
<div>parents - visiting her, me visiting in dallas.</div>
<div>bad fem. things. making websites.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>michael, how was molly?</div>
<div>didn’t work.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>quick gym at planet fitness the worst gym because so crowded and all weights, benches taken.</div>
<div>and home. working. small interface tweaks. productive as far as small tweaks go, resolving look of filter pop-out for hospital quality visual.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>recalling - with sabrina. maybe dancing. and then her saying ‘let’s find everyone’? because, presumably too sloppy.</div>
<div>over and over.</div>
<div>before - at park slope pregame. usual fare: rihanna music vids, dance videos, junglepussy. caroline, new guy will, sabrina evan, and ~dan, cute gf angela, lena, alex. </div>
<div>the word woof being ‘appropriated’ from white male gay community. and then; </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today.</div>
<div>11am. awake. clothes intact (like jean shorts, belt, wallet, everything).</div>
<div>because : too drunk last night.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>journal documents only what isn’t obvious to me. but prevailing mental states not documented because like not trying to talk to myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now alive and well. 2pm. after: bottle of water, attempting to re-sleep, juice, bagel, coffee. this is what it takes.</div>
<div>baba echoing in head.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>who are these small azn kids always hanging at father knows best.</div>
<div>starting a loneliness list.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>wallowing in self-regret. thinking of others perceiving me like</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>7/22</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a</div>
<div>positive /</div>
<div>negative day</div>
<div>morning </div>
<div>sunny workout productive positive</div>
<div>long call w baba</div>
<div>nida’a - mead’s sister as a marriage opportunity.</div>
<div>and like</div>
<div>this is real</div>
<div>and </div>
<div>not ready for marriage but wary of coming off across as full of myself. like no one is good enough to meet</div>
<div>or maybe</div>
<div>secretly thinking i won’t find love and may need fallback plan?</div>
<div>and noor officially unofficially married?</div>
<div>but ‘don’t let her spend any time with ahmed'</div>
<div>strict</div>
<div>1 hr + long conversation.</div>
<div>80% unsolicited, 20% solicited advice related to cost quality tool</div>
<div>fixated on this being a user tool to find best hospital</div>
<div>and what management wants</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>—work</div>
<div>frustrated by indecision</div>
<div>expand cost quality app with comparison filter</div>
<div>or just highlight one axis and allow user to change coloring</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>nightly tinder + bumble</div>
<div>way more matches these days</div>
<div>and actual responses</div>
<div>and delaying my responses</div>
<div>but then realizing no one is that clever so i can send unstimulating how are you's</div>
<div>and this girl lauren cute lauren replying</div>
<div>and then texting feibi</div>
<div>i’ll do something</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>dinner w may, small japanese minimalist restaurant</div>
<div>left feeling underwhelmed and just sort of sad</div>
<div>a bit about ‘i feel like you get so..’life’ when you’re around me'</div>
<div>the days</div>
<div>loneliness</div>
<div>archery, may’s weekends</div>
<div>leaving dinner maybe 45 min after (may late too)</div>
<div>pre-made plans to see margot at 10</div>
<div>so leaving, no ‘hey let’s hang later'</div>
<div>but a ‘will you be around from me?’. and a (imagined reluctance) with: ‘yea hit me up'</div>
<div>intestines in my stomach and self hate wafting in my brain</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home and.</div>
<div>a noise experimental album.</div>
<div>sitting on the bed.</div>
<div>scrolling fb, insta, swiping, sending messages</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>7/23 (sat morning)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>awake and awash in self-pity</div>
<div>awash</div>
<div>rolling around bed, sleepy but mind racing. surrendering to the day.</div>
<div>shower, peanut butter date toast (actually +)</div>
<div>all the while playing and replaying my overall relationship to may</div>
<div>in forms of: me talking to someone else about it. ‘like i mean i know she owes me nothing but she hasn’t checked in on me. even when realizing i’m lonely’.</div>
<div>to myself. roughly the same thing, but in a less verbal, more radially expansive sort of self-pity and sadness.</div>
<div>yesterday tried texting - feibi (after giving no.), patchi, may, tinder girl, dan fethke for weed. nothing materializing.</div>
<div>how can people be confidence, with direct evidence that others may not like them, that you fucked up, etc? self-forgiveness? or..faith. faith i suppose.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday / fri</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>somewhat productive working most day. bathaus. conversation with game dev. interested in d3. opened a food truck, made money, and - learned how to code games with no experience. now freelance game dev.</div>
<div>first clients primarily through meet ups. realizing - data vis freelance could be ~~real.</div>
<div>showed him visual before leaving. a sort of smile, thinking aesthetically it looks great. but def incredibly confusing. friendly, saying next time he can play with it / see how it works.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in loops, working in loops. building idea of filters that work from above and below, allowing to show two profiles. but realizing that first profile must be greater in each value than second. limited comparison. also confusing. so back to - two profile comparison. working well, end of day.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>okay. gym &amp; home. working more..then a meandering walk to maria hernandez park. well, bookstore first. chai on the way, 1min conversation with variety worker ‘day was art productive and now coffee productive’. classic artist hustle-side-hustle. entering with idea: need whimsical fiction book (sleep-deprived girl working there has no suggestion) and leaving with .. virginia woolf. attempting to read at park, but stopping, 5 pages in. watching surroundings, listening to american football (and inevitably..jade). also - jade - no response to: ‘how did your show go?’.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>repetition rumination</div>
<div>social inadequacy</div>
<div>self pity</div>
<div>not fitting in</div>
<div>where do i fit in</div>
<div>looking at lukas winklerprins interviews with creative grads trying to figure it out</div>
<div>am i one of these people?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>need to - pick pick pick the self myself up. drink some confidence.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then</div>
<div>blue velvet. watching it. engaged and well-made, but side conversation still going on. checking phone periodically. very periodically. </div>
<div>quick talk w robin before bed</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>life is good is great. delving into new creative things here in this amazing city but somehow need for validation, confidence, and social love trumps, largely blinds</div>
<div><br/></div>

<en-note>On United flight
<div>Other version of me is worried about 1 hour delay between flight and connect, particularly b/c sitting all the way in back </div>
<div>But me, not worried</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Up at 2:30 / showe + coffee + thoughts of how flyknits are half size too big </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Is narrative project worth including in portfolio?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Reimagining layout of website cards</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Yesterday - </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Distracted paralysis </div>
<div>Unproductive. Realizing that sleep / writing / music may help but content to stay discontent, distracted </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Comfort, luxury in Boston </div>
<div>Happy in room</div>
<div>Boston, not my city not my city </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>— okay never finished, 2 tired, crammed on plane</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>8/5</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>waking up, alarms missed. in the airbnb capsule - no window/light. shower, immediately. lesley, small-talking about losing credit card. dry mouth, groggy head, mustering a simple ‘mm’ with smile.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sitting in kafka’s coffee. coffee / vibes good, art questionable. ‘but not the wild bits’. fabric with little threads handing, in different colors. </div>
<div>afternoon. returning to apartment after morning excursion to 49th parallel. indecision paralysis, wondering: take laptop? or no. decide: not not to.</div>
<div>granville island. too touristy, a little underwhelming. ice cream, listening into conversation between two plain-looking, well educated, white young men. about sister, kim, and graduate school in Univ. of Cambridge.</div>
<div>(morning, finishing up that thesis page, editing ui of patient profile).</div>
<div>with kareem, texts - how was wedding, how is school? </div>
<div>vancouver, a distinct air.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>opening, closing website: do i like this?</div>
<div>in my head. comparing self, side by side, to data vis artists i chose to follow on twitter. how far i am, grad school?..</div>
<div>setting up a twitter. posting bits from ‘adulthood’ list. no likes (only 4 followers, granted)..but, feeling self-conscious, wanting to retract. this is good, good for me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>identity is arbitrary</div>
<div>horrible fantasies of entire family dying. why?</div>
<div>too slow, too slow in work progress</div>
<div>imagining - back to work. the routine, confinement. what what will i do, even?</div>
<div>quit coffee until work</div>
<div>okay let’s not listen to music and absorb the city</div>
<div>a slight rejection of new and shiny places, buildings, districts. did not realize, but stand, in head, as antithesis of culture.</div>
<div>sambas or new vans? or others? now leaning new vans. black or white? old school or new?</div>
<div>vancouver the clean cut (even when tattooed hipster). though maybe comparing to brooklyn.</div>
<div>skinny, feeling skinny need to get mad super ripped when back.</div>
<div>boston &amp; comfort of home.</div>
<div>reporter app what am i even doing with this personal data</div>
<div>damn that espresso went by too quickly </div>
<div>a girl i need a girl at least for a little please, a girl?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>8/4</div>
<div> </div>
<div>wedding</div>
<div>(usual morning work / coffee..7pm espresso from previous night = restless sleep)</div>
<div>picked up by omid. small, harmless, dorky, likable man. older, unmarried (freelance app/) software developer. the type to clutch little anecdotes, share enthusiastically. bears near the wedding venue property, showing video, making jokes. easy chat most of the way..</div>
<div>early 1.5 hours to venue. sprawling golf course. beaming sun, still air. </div>
<div>taking photos, carrying (heavy) light for nabil’s cousin (from minneapolis, works in healthcare / photography for fun). witnessing chemistry between nail &amp; nika. natural, comfortable, endearing. poses: with golf club, on path looking back, etc etc.</div>
<div>nabil’s dad - recognizing me after saying name, mother: calling me kareem, shadi though, remembering me (though adding: you look different. good thing, most likely).</div>
<div>outdoor ceremony. poetry (arabic, farsi, english), singing, formal (meaningless) speeches. earnest, simple.</div>
<div>outside: getting refreshments, meeting the khaliji persians. sort of hitting off, getting number, maybe: hang out? cities, social life, small talk topics with real talk depth. </div>
<div>wedding. touching narration of nabil/nika’s genesis. a year of confusing mixed signals, bits of nabil outright saying ‘i miss my mom’ after nika’s failed cooking. beautiful seamless and honest speech. </div>
<div>at table, talking to: nabil’s coworker who worked in bahai center in israel. thomas, bahai convert, uToronto philosophy professor (/sort of Harvard prof). ancient philosophy. how does faith and philosophy relate? rationality = separate. talking also of: boston, new york. would love to meet, have coffee with this guy, thinking. how the baha’i faith encourages ‘independent investigations of faith’. test a principle for yourself. </div>
<div>(okay the black vans are definitely better for work, now -&gt; old or new school? white or black sole? why am i getting this again? oh b/c rain..)</div>
<div>touched &amp; inspired by these people..genuinely kind, present, engaged in conversations</div>
<div>snapchat feed to dhahran crew</div>
<div>in some ways feeling like i am a secondary friend to nabil. behind: the baha’i, persian communities. understandable, 100 percent. brain is a bit quick to cling to: feeling othered.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lesley — </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>**earlier, brooklyn</div>
<div>tanya’s pregnancy + start of intimate exchanges</div>
<div>unknown mortal orchestra on the last night, w may</div>
<div>back to somerville. cloudy day, slow. cultural drop, but loving luxury, comfort, company of adam and siavash</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>8/17 - retrospective</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today - with adam, just now, conversation about: days. cute girl at tennis, how to ask her out? the ‘what do you do’ question. a long walk home, beautiful day.</div>
<div>recalling: dental bills. bills bills bills.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>mind state. scattered. in transit, thinking: what do i have to do? errands, which errands? deciding: single speed or geared bike? adidas samba classic (with tongue) or newer version (no tongue, supposedly less comfy). smaller nikes or bigger? loop. this g star raw denim. will it stretch / should i size up one? and of course googling - sizing. samba classic vs originals. single speed bikes. consuming, all-consuming. do i need another pair, another pair of shoes? </div>
<div>(eventually, converging on: single speed, formal casual office attire with sambas/button-down or polo. may’s bday present.</div>
<div>breaking through background noise at the gym, running running (stride is good, fuck the initial lifting plan). shower after, contacts out, and headache, tiredness, largely gone.</div>
<div>outside, at the playground, reading, drifting off into errand-land, and - watching considering weighing the words of young father to baby to himself. ‘we’re gonna shower, then have a snaaack...'</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>texting tanya. curt replies. sense of dislike, and surge of thoughts/text ideas to fix this? no fixing needed, tanya is miles away. no attachment. (don’t let yourself be moved).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>monday - dinner with angela. cooking for her. talking about the various ‘events’ in the summer. tame impala concert. a little bit of: brooklyn vs somerville comparison. the malaysia plan, frustration with project management (angela essentially handling all of project).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>fantasy of smoking, drifting off into night. reading, thinking, music, or something?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(coffee-less, past few days. sleeping more, sleeping well, afternoon crash)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>8/12 - 8/14:</div>
<div>vt. absolute bliss. ‘life is amazing’ type groans.</div>
<div>scenes:</div>
<div>on the deck, middle of pond. ahead, a paved path. carved, curated. the house, in the distance. depth of hills, clouds, scene, drawing perception to house.</div>
<div>beach house. waves of sun, storm. in the heat, on the deck. in the water, on the deck. bits of easy conversation. feet in the water, lying down.</div>
<div>cookie chips </div>
<div>kim - super cool / approachable. (and honestly so attractive..). girl i need a girl.</div>
<div>LIGHTNING STORM. absolutely breathtaking. the entire sky lighting, erupting. firework show, really. </div>
<div>basketball + pool</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so fulfilling fulfilled</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>8/15-8/16</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>overall house vibes strong</div>
<div>dinner / cooking together yesterday</div>
<div>watching show called ‘casual'</div>
<div>realizing the ali g undertones that have been pervading the house.</div>
<div>tinder social group</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>--</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>8/18</div>
<div>An errand robot = how my last break before work spent</div>
<div>but like well dressed errand robot?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Late night</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Cruising with the bike tame impala and the calm ocean like traffic.</div>
<div>Journal self analysis visual type thoughts</div>
<div>I want to do everything make music listen to music bike code type mood</div>
<div>With Adam and Siavash, joint at the spot and banter. This house type humor. Don't share the classification it ruins the vibe.</div>
<div>Pant sizes, shoe sizes, most of day. Mostly resolved </div>
<div>Young thug as paintings</div>
<div>Yea i’m munching as reality and chorus of a song potentially</div>
<div>Exhilarating / feeling difference of fancier / single speed bike wow so maybe i have a little taste. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>8/20</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(lately)</div>
<div>reading murakami, spending time alone / not working, failing to make decisions = </div>
<div>channeling lost feeling from characters</div>
<div>and frank ocean’s endless.</div>
<div>the only thing compelling me to go back to work is: a little bit of direction.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>currently at diesel. the goal: feel, hear, different sounds and people, escape the social regret from previous night.</div>
<div>regret? not sure why. kim and friend (syrian) roya over. at first, lively, vibrant, fun banter. walking in while adam and i baking wheat thins. clumsily opening beer bottles. smoking, frank ocean video dragging on (now reading reviews / criticism). and after (end of night) - </div>
<div>somehow a distaste a regret - for myself? (also feeling the post-weed or just end-night tiredness, long long walk). feeling.. like i wasn’t curious enough about roya, didn’t ask enough questions. just stopped at hearing about work (she did same). but like: it was mainly normal. moving past small talk not just dependent on me. and overall like a normal nice social time with someone you just met. especially given empty house extreme quiet vibe. mind operating at suburban quaint pace sort of thing. </div>
<div>regret clearly resting on a need to have super meaningful encounters really early into a relationship.</div>
</div>
<div>an unfair expectation..need to rid of.</div>
<div>(also: blame it on the weed)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>balling w adam, blasting future and friends near kids in playground. and, walking back to house: conversation about how, post-grad, and particularly post-brooklyn, especially wary of white people.</div>
<div>how this is justified.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>aim lately to develop more cohesive state of mind.</div>
<div>need to journal more, develop feedback loop with self-narrative so i don’t become empty.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>what pre-work errand things are left?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>apple store (delay to later), g-star raw store credit (just settle for this and, if online-purchased jeans don’t work out, come back and get those size 28 pants) — let’s say, do this on a saturday in one month</div>
<div>later: separate bank account</div>
<div>ok.</div>
<div>most things done.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>except now headache with amazon shipment headed to address in providence.</div>
<div>(call brown mailroom on monday and fix this issue otherwise)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div>8/21</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>am i am i</div>
<div>talking to myself enough</div>
<div>am i am i (&lt;- sort of visually compelling)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>outside</div>
<div>a joint at the spot</div>
<div>siavash’s sister (alala) keeping company (cig in hand)</div>
<div>talking about how we do many impressions</div>
<div>mama hating my swag</div>
<div>etc</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and now back</div>
<div>quiet</div>
<div>putting back dried clothes</div>
<div>checking my website</div>
<div>siavash recording vacuum sounds, adam in shower</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a judgmental first encounter with jules, narrated by siavash</div>
<div>(me ironing on wooden table - why are you ironing on wooden table? asks alala)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>stretching, groin cracked and weird residual pain mainly mental pain </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>weekend</div>
<div>a stream</div>
<div>a nice stream</div>
<div>hanging out with kim + roya</div>
<div>- cool ass syrian-american girl, went to risd</div>
<div>marriage material</div>
<div>first night. frank ocean ‘endless’ stream. unanimously complaining about video. over apricots, apple slices, and baked wheat thins.</div>
<div>and then: rooftop.</div>
<div>(me, walking back, regretting social interaction. but really was normal nice and moved at normal pace)</div>
<div>home after.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>next day. rooftop, again. near sunset time. banter. royal wearing blue dress, white oxford shoes. both so attractive. </div>
<div>but thinking about</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(super self conscious about my writing, switching tabs as siavash walks in, looks at screen)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sex dreams w tanya usual</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back in the house - streaming frank ocean blond. touching, nuanced, minimal. beautiful.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(the night: restless)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>8/22</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back2work. first day. the energy level a bit off. from the start, waking up tired &amp; groggy.</div>
<div>and getting to work too early, doddling.</div>
<div>nick looking like he’s approaching me but really just throwing something away. ‘hey’ startling him.</div>
<div>and then getting started. documentation first, but design on the horizon.</div>
<div>one day in, already thinking: do i have bidness drive in me? should i just go back to school, but designer analyst type?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at work. going around in circles. vague instructions, inability to ask question (nick leaving room frequently). unable to penetrate surface, simply drawing the same flowchart, deleting and re-adding. editing wiki. how should i restructure?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>with mike, lunch. conversation focused &amp; flowing the whole way. but energy level down.</div>
<div>tonight, goal: restore energy. </div>
<div>work is the focus now, the focus.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>texts from julia on the way back. frank ocean in my ears. watching the 350 - the diverse 350. hey, commute is diverse at least.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>beautiful breezy walk home.let go of time, no need to get at a time just keep wandering.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>

<en-note>

	<div>a new document.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>writing largely to deliberately ‘to exist’</div>

	<div>because in office, do not exist</div>

	<div>i mean day going by</div>

	<div>staying until 6:30 and not too painful</div>

	<div>but indoors all day. could feel color of skin dwindling. compiling, compiling documents.</div>

	<div>needing coffee in the morning. and afternoon. energy dwindling. better today than yesterday.</div>

	<div>just need - energy, optimism, meetings?</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>the commute back. around 42 min bike / bus combo. not too bad. talking with gino a little on the way, mainly practical things like houses and bikes. frank ocean carrying me through ride.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>stalling at the mass / cameron ave intersection</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>back home, balling. days? with adam. cute girl at the opposite side of court, putting up shots.</div>

	<div>catching up with kareem, on the birthday. dental school start: fascinating, grueling. alexis. amazing. but conflicts: telling parents. potential trip plans</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>in the head. shaky shaky. but need to shake off the shaky shaky. acquire a uni-directional focus. thinking like need to delve super deep, saturate myself in data now.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>an accurate awareness now, of typeface, and digital interactions.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>okay. brain like no want to sleep. contemplating smoking but like really shouldn’t. so sleep. murakami or datives before bed?</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>8/25</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>the usual - grasping myself, writing to try to exist ...</div>

	<div>fiddling with arcadia wiki css</div>

	<div>frank ocean playing</div>

	<div>(drastically changing my mindset - tired, dreading work, to light coding, in the zone, swaying singing)</div>

	<div>and </div>

	<div>a moment</div>

	<div>of emotion</div>

	<div>looking out the window</div>

	<div>aware of myself and broader life and where i am and where i’m working</div>

	<div>and then back to work</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>company outing today</div>

	<div>reeks of organized fun</div>

	<div>reeks. we’re adults / can’t we just hang out somewhere scenic with good food?</div>

	<div>volleyball. quite fun. rob calling me harsh, gino being gino. the annoying things, what i’m listing. </div>

	<div>level of conversation - thinking could be a visual</div>

	<div>but level of conversation just small talk.</div>

	<div>just small talk.</div>

	<div>bumper boats. zip lining with copans and his (tall) kids. relaxing, pleasant, heartwarming to watch conversation with his kids.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>difficulty getting back into work zone. doing allotted, scattered tasks. commuting, coming home, etc. just..tired really. (at casey’s yesterday: saying, everyone has been tired this week. conspiracy joke but maybe fall onset? no. not that. would be nice to have car, commute easily, come home and continue working.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>but need to. to make: case for staying in product management. to work on personal data projects, build portfolio.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>and now, getting sucked into work. thinking: don’t forget brooklyn. freelancing, unconventional lives, etc. just. remember to constantly swim and navigate the world.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>an urge to smoke weed but - urge is tied to an image of chilling, being relaxed, and puffing. puffing, not actually instantly high. so addicted to this chill image, but not actual smoking?</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>back at home. a medley of vegetables, and practical talk about missing rent money. bit of: coffee w/ almond milk in hand. conversation wandering, eventually. with adam, comfort, natural flow.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>the flow. where does your flow take you?</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>last night. hanging with casey and lena. skating along western ave, perfect. and then, chatting and eating, dissolving into couch. mm.</div>

	<div>and back home. reading in bed, crashing.</div><div><br/></div><div>Vashty dr report</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>9/2</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>noelle showing up, first night with ‘da boiz'</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>9/3</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>tame night, no smoking</div>

	<div>ball</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>9/4</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>A cushy night riding out in cabs</div>

	<div>Picturing myself at home listening to music lying down and writing or smoking or something of the like but likely just wheat thins and sleep</div>

	<div>A call from Stef in the cab. Stranger listening in, asking: girlfriend? Err..ex. What do you think of Somerville? Exchanges. Though living downtown, judging based on cab?</div>

	<div>Red vans all black with a white stripe on my sweater</div>

	<div>Did my foot grow because shoes feel smaller?</div>

	<div>Connor Clark emerging, over 6 feet tall. A true Texas man. Currently: working on the oil fields. 2 weeks on one off. reasonable, friendly, as i had imagined. </div>

	<div>Texas football game on the laptop. a good game actually.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>

		<div>talking about</div>

	</div>

	<div>things in abstract details with reef afraid of surface level conversation both of us</div>

	<div>will get deeper later</div>

	<div>but scratching surface of, different places he’s visited. 2 weeks in saudi, 6 in berkeley, a few in minnesota, and now back. and classes this semester: object oriented. other things. loving it, it seems.</div>

	<div>and him, recalling ambition to get on the product team.</div>

	<div>in the cab ride, ‘what was that about? this nick guy’. </div>

	<div>talking a little bit about life on oil rig.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>Nick something, the stereotypical Boston bro. Rocking: lighblue sagging joggers, white v neck T, and gold chain. (high school with Josh - was this kid really in cushing? or just j wu). Living in Southie. Loves, truly passionately loves Boston. Planning: a skyline photo in new apartment. Gold frames. Then: boston sports team paraphernalia. talking about how awesome it is that lighthouse in boston is covered in Tom Brady gear. first conversation muttered from his mouth. </div>

	<div>Recalling a story of: showing up outside police department with trench coat, metal bar and gun in pocket. Meeting uber driver who stole phone. But wasn't arrested. Was arrested a different time, fuckin, in own fuckin bedroom, playing with DJ equipment at 4am. Fuckin.</div>

	<div>Fuckin as transition word. Um. Fuckinnnn. Fuckkkinnnnn.</div>

	<div>Yaseen exchanging an arrest story - for missing court date. cops calling phone in saudi. </div>

	<div>nick. unbelievable. blasting music on **full volume**. awful edm, predictable drop, canny female voice singing anthemic, meaningless chorus. lowers volume only to recite a fun boston fact (tea party was over there, my boy runs this shit over here), or talk to himself, to everybody else (fuck i really love this place). you are a real person?! </div>

	<div>self-talking tidbits: going through phone, narrative ‘which girls to text’, arrives at ‘the slut’, sends message (while narrating), and concludes story with ‘i love pussy’. a real live human.</div>

	<div>and then, pulling out box. box that was - very conveniently - unpacked. and, like magician pulling things out of hat, continues to make bongs, smoking pieces magically appear. maybe 10? and then: footlong rolling paper. (a decent story of, out in the wilderness, camping, much weed but nothing to smoke with, stumbling upon a small glass piece. exaggerating how eyebrows, faces were slightly burnt while desperately smoking this tiny piece that appeared). accompanying story of: three foot long joint, distributed among three people.</div>

	<div>has been up, apparently, for three days straight with ‘nothing but naps’. ‘cook life man i’ll sleep when i’m dead’.</div>

	<div>mannerisms. gratuitous hand gestures. limited in movement by masculinity, so a bit jerky, quick.</div>

	<div>‘I FUCKING LOVE MY CITY’. fuckin.</div>

	<div>double parking, southie style.</div>

	<div>a list. boasting about: connections in clubs. amount of smoking paraphernalia. amount smoked. DJing. getting arrested. options with girls.</div>

	<div>using italian american slang like ‘agida’. agitated type thing.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>in southie. past the water. young professional mainly, a bit denser, newer than somerville, narrower streets. less neighborhood feel. but externally, somewhat nice.</div>

	<div>at the bar: a sudden sharpness as drink and joint fade away. feeling good. great. girl dropping petals on my head, in a nice dress. clearly came back from someone’s wedding. saying that she is marrying guy next to her, in athletic clothing (who seems to care little for her). calling the bs, and getting punched, more petals on my head. bar = 100% white (minus yaseen). polos, button downs, boat shoes. uniformly. last call at around 1. back in nick’s car, maniacal driving, horrendous music, but nice, easy conversation with yaseen. </div>

	<div>uber back, called by yaseen. too nice.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>justifying time to self as: this interesting. standing by this i suppose.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>Moving more slowly towards a state of: contentment, focus, ridding of restlessness. Less desire to smoke, get fucked up. Maybe cemented partly by seeing aramcons - cool aramcons regress life-wise. my own ambition suddenly in desperate defense.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>scene of south like somerville but newer more densely packed</div>

	<div>the italian slang word</div>

	<div>where i am in society</div>

	<div>intellectualization </div>

	<div>being friends with stupid people</div>

	<div>stupid people?</div>

	<div>this guy is so passionate about this objectively (?) shitty bass drop</div>

	<div>but so passionate</div>

	<div>how</div>

	<div>if so much passion</div>

	<div>how can it be misdirected</div>

	<div>where does it arise</div>

	<div>what motivates his person to be sleep deprived for days and play ear numbing music</div>

	<div>if: indeed an objectively unpleasant unnecessary human experience</div>

	<div>then purely self perception, self narrative</div>

	<div>what a strong and overpowering thing</div>

	<div>you become who you think you are</div>

	<div>etc</div>

	<div>thinking about osmervile from north carolina perspective</div>

	<div>yaseen of course talking up</div>

	<div>these are really just boys from home </div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>(continuing from 9/2)</div>

	<div>writing from the new backyard</div>

	<div>directly in front me, my bike. old chairs folded in, out, thrown on the floor to the right. odd items. and directly ahead, a strange black and white patterned fence blocking just one portion of neighbor’s backyard.</div>

	<div>look we have a backyard.</div>

	<div>a back porch.</div>

	<div>strawberries in oats yum</div>

	<div>and also - more of an appetite lately.</div>

	<div>calming, neighborhood feel in the new place. sterility makes a difference, contrary to what i imagined.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>yesterday: a trip to target, hardware store. few things acquired. will stick to online. (a multi-colored storage desk is what i planned).</div>

	<div>while wearing vans, feet feeling tight: i’m definitely a size 9. finally, the shoe size dilemma evaporating.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>earlier, at trip to target. an eccentric, slightly flamboyant, jamaican dude. lived in brooklyn, flatbush most of life. now in new hampshire. loves suburbs, peace and quiet. just finished nursing school, but wants to keep going for md. </div>

	<div>now, to call mama and baba.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>9/6 </div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>following convo with vash about methods for forcing oneself to get out of funk, be productive, deciding to journal journal stay sharp be awake.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>so today at work.</div>

	<div>wiki re-styling. stayed up late - after sarah left, yaseen asleep to finish re-styling. merged with docs and **crash. half of day spent fixing and finalizing.</div>

	<div>rest of time: getting print-ready wiki.</div>

	<div>product team meeting. strategizing. lira review, extended. then strategy moving forward, outstanding issues. surprisingly organic.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div>rest of week:</div>

	<div>     finish pdf print</div>

	<div>     start hoc risk algo</div>

	<div>rainy gloomy</div>

	<div>too late and too much time spent being me so no more journal</div><div><br/></div><div>How to retain power while remaining empathetic </div><div>Podcast: using empathy as tools to navigate power structures </div><div>Then losing empathy</div><div>I wonde: do you still have emoathy, but instead for first world problems?</div>

<div>9/12</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>monday morning. short hair (fresh cut), breakfast with the house pending.</div>
<div>that’s it. breakfast time so never finished.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now continuing, 9/13.</div>
<div>the body. a bit stiff. knees somewhat brittle. single speed bike? sitting all day at work, not even a little walk. and and - back to circuit workouts. feeling more fit, getting more lean - but also, for first time, questioning sustainability of workouts. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today. fresh from work. relatively early (6:30), nick out, mike + luke leaving. so, at home, sifting through closet, unloading into new mini dresser. mini. isiah rashad bumping. taking stream of music with me: walking in somerville. past sundry white people. a beautiful and calm day. in control, sort of. walking by Spoke like this is a nice date spot actually not really a bit too intimate like what would i do on a date maybe i should get back on tinder and try to find a date? thought dropped. feeling my body, strange to walk. it’s comfortable here. how quickly i’ve moved on from brooklyn. on the bike, the same thoughts, but somehow more true - or rather, verified - in motion.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>crackling sounds, from nico jaar. revisiting in light of ~nico jaar show in providence. adam in shower. stalling to synchronize dinner. and getting ~in touch with myself. because where have i been, days fading?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>days fading but it’s not so bad. i mean going by. not interminable. feeling relatively unproductive. but restlessness dissipating, some focus taking place.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night. eid mubarak calls - the intention. result: a single, 1.5 hour call to meral. and a missed call from adam. with meral, talking in depth about psych rotations. now supervising people. and shaayaan’s wedding, an amazing time. and me: back to somerville. new place. weird times with yaseen &amp; co. and other weird stories because i’m weird (&lt;- meral).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back in the house. working a bit on this twilio BS. </div>
<div>what do i need to spark me and energize me. i think i’m sharp, focused. etc. but need a spark.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then vash home around 10:30. us on the couch, talking about end of other people label. but nico show. and and. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a restless sleep.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lately in product land.  </div>
<div>(interrupted)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>9/17</div>
<div>1:15 post night chilling in davis hood</div>
<div>sucked into tinder</div>
<div>one reply and one robot that at first seemed real?</div>
<div>re-examining website</div>
<div>thoughts of</div>
<div>feeling inspired inspiration okay now maybe i kinda wanna build things</div>
<div>today sort of a productive day at work</div>
<div>finished wiki, progress on risk stuff</div>
<div>with guys all night</div>
<div>a cult of people who take new members and look at their stomachs</div>
<div>siavash laughing</div>
<div>siavash’s riveting, detailed gory story of surgery and all its drama</div>
<div>awake for most</div>
<div>image of it without processing, attached emotion or sentiment</div>
<div>fascinating</div>
<div>his day</div>
<div>seafood ramen chilling party meeting japanese dude</div>
<div>and japanese dude manager of submarine</div>
<div>sleeps like 3 hours / day</div>
<div>crazy life</div>
<div>why</div>
<div>then submarine videos</div>
<div>shockingly high text thinking of permutations for error god must be so much greater in 3d space though i suppose more open space less need to be precise but still comparatively crazy</div>
<div>writing and coming back to life feels good</div>
<div>now gaining focus feeling better about life and work overall </div>
<div>weird afternoons of 2 much coffee and weird snack and sitting and weird</div>
<div>today thinking about gym sustainability like hm maybe this is actually getting boring been doing this shit for a while </div>
<div>revamping interfaces for the company</div>
<div>like away from phone less and able to focus on activities for long periods of time and overall relatively stable</div>
<div>but hey i need a girl</div>
<div>and then yesterday - well before, let’s talk about before first - angela. dinner with angela. and like damn she’s cute but taken now.</div>
<div>speculating like if she’s interested or if that would work and what it would be like</div>
<div>guess i don’t know</div>
<div>then day after dinner with vira. area 4. dainty fancy semi-hipster industrial pharmaceutical vibes. her setting in quickly, boyfriend and all. good place, car, job. all that. about her brother, precocious and too cool for his age. life w me. social life. what’s that?</div>
<div>new room like dope</div>
<div>man should i can i be corporate forever</div>
<div>a couple joints tonight</div>
<div>outside talking about?&gt;</div>
<div>before siavash came in dramatically</div>
<div>with adam</div>
<div>comfort of living here, bbq speculation</div>
<div>contacts lately</div>
<div>loving the new rug</div>
<div>tasting dry bread with siavash, him wanting me to eat with some pb to experience what he experienced and me thinking  - what a demanding thing - complete and utter attention and domination of someone’s state of mind. with a conversation, the slightest amount of attention and brain space a privilege. </div>
<div>woo</div>

<div>9/19</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mon morning, waking up, thoughts racing. (Falling asleep, thoughts racing - the puffs of j precipitating thought avalanche. Work and Angela and Tanya and girls girls girls). Over and over in head, Isaiah Rashad. Roll up for the shqwa. And then .. Pop a xanny, make yo problems go away. Image of him with son on loop. (A short Isaiah rashad, one of the first things this morning. Tired start, shower, white button down, black slacks, Stan smith (not meshing as well as I expected but good enough / comfy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(Missed bus, so outside, in Arlington, writing. Sign up for kickboxing soon? Mass bjj directly across)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And thinking of: siavash's dominating personality. A quick question about sql table leading to him overtaking computer, trying solution (shouldn't have asked..). When walking into room, demanding complete attention. Would give anyone complete attention I suppose, but vash with enough self importance to demand that. And somehow roped into smoking, when really not feeling that. Tho maybe fact that Adam was too.</div>
<div>And dominating conversations - on phone, too. Like. Me, not dominant.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Sitting in living room, projecting videos for: Vince staples prima Donna, ras g, Isaiah, and then - curb. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The day Sunday mostly errands laundry cooking sort of thing. Phone calls to Tanya (for an hour, hmhm), Noor. Thanksgiving?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Saturday. Breakfast and: directly outside, to Davis. Nine bar, murakami. At nine bar, me awkward, half looking at guy w glasses who I've ordered from many times (shouldn't I at least ask how he's doing), half at coffee strains though ordering cold brew so no choice there. Next time less aekward, okay? Conversations about respective dogs, ahead of me. Their personality traits, tendencies, and recent life events. Still cannot lift the 'white people weird’ opinion, when dogs come up.</div>
<div>Beautiful outside.</div>
<div>Spanish speaking man asking for directions to 87 bus. Thinking: this is interesting. This man, stranger, asking me things. Murakami' world growing more complex..the book sort of about arbitrariness of attempting to derive meaning from life. Driven mainly by decision to be a certain type of person. Tho maybe murakami differs in this regard, characters seeming to fall into personality / tendency against will. Until 1pm, sitting out. Then: back in the house. To siavash's room, bringing bbq strategy and immediately: vibe, idea, enthusiasm killed. How he doesn't really want to get a car because then it's a thing. (Even tho, me driving an getting car). All these little qualifiers, told with a tone that undermined idea and framed it as burden inflicted on him. Personality dominance here: things imposed into vash, that serve others better, much less important. </div>
<div>Rant rant rant. Reminding self that: Siavash freee to do as he pleases, communicate whatever opinion about this bbq. Tho inconsiderate, I shouldn't be dominated by his opinion. (In a sense, his fault that personality is dominant, but in situation like this, not trying deliberately to dominate. In care ride too: quiet. Which is okay. But somewhat insulting, because the silence dominates and swallows our enthusiasm). </div>
<div>At u haul, filling propane tank and getting bbq advice from foresight-filled man filling his backup tank even though no bbq directly in sight.</div>
<div>(Now, bus stop. Woman, Indian perhaps, dressed in all purple. A wool type dress. Damn..)</div>
<div>Directly after returning from bbq endeavors, Siavash leaving. Discussing the nature of vibe kill, how not entirely mal-intentioned but still not cool. And quietly, getting to bbq work. A little bit of forced enthusiasm. Around 6 (time of bbq). Everything in place. Speakers blasting. Sitting on couch, a relaxed sigh. Casey, then Angela. 'Do we like X?'</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Cowboy bepop</div>

<div>Journal. Thoughts spilling but not eloquently. Get back on it..</div>

<div>9/20</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This morning a half hour snooze I don't remember</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Last night: Adam resonating over personality episode of invisibilia. Resonating. Personality as fluid. Directing conversation to indecisiveness, career.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Morning. Death grips the main motivation behind 3 mile run. Leisurely coffee, ny times after. </div>

<div>tinder. not terribly unsuccessful lately.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking back to the summer. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work, mainly.</div>
<div>in response to ‘what’s on head’</div>
<div>stimulated and focused the whole day and not even sleeping well so perplexing</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>should sleep</div>
<div>the sort of manic i want to do everything high feeling tho</div>
<div>but yet.</div>
<div>must work out</div>

<div>9/24</div>

<div>#theotherhalf</div>
<div>a good tagline for..something?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today, a car to work. </div>
<div>yesterday. trip back. delirious but slightly coffee wired. in traffic. tim hecker playing, sunset. fantasies of: getting high (maybe), going on long bike ride, listening to music, and writing. (still quite feasible).</div>
<div>(did not follow through. ate / made lunch, did a lil work, then: presidential debate)</div>
<div>work more </div>
<div>but be alive</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>listening to beautiful anonymous. a slightly awkward call. and really didn’t go past surface. but still managed 1 hour conversation out of someone who isn’t that willing to give too much about themselves. </div>
<div>thinking: sometimes conversations just awkward (even with best conversationalist). and with this, a train of thoughts - socializing. when it’s meaningful to me. do i enjoy only when it’s ‘getting me somewhere’. like only talk about self if doing so will show this train of thought in new light.but then: the motivation to just share. share yourself, your thought. if i see this as privilege from others, should think the same about myself. </div>

<div>self categorization, of course</div>

<div>on the bus today, and bike, both ways. at home, riding in the super dark. cold. already. nico jar new album sounding beautiful.</div>
<div>and before: booma collective. blown away by beats vash has shown me.</div>
<div>needing to prepare resume for josh right right</div>
<div>at work  i need to need to get this done but really i don't</div>
<div>so horny lately</div>
<div>nico jaar wow.</div>
<div>for moments long moments today just giving myself up to the music</div>
<div>amazing an amazing feeling</div>
<div>with adam talking about our days. him: lunch at home again. dope dope like skipping school default dope. </div>
<div>i suppose i feel more secure with myself lately </div>
<div>invite a party with all of everyone we know, cool or not (with a light drawn somewhere) is the plan.</div>
<div>looking at these words sideways like it’s a graph. why no word wrap on this shit.</div>
<div>just slightly restless judging on gum i chew throughout day, coffee i drink.</div>
<div>how many states of mind have i been traveling through lately? </div>
<div>not spilling the words</div>
<div>the thoughts tho</div>
<div>these extremely visceral sounds from what siavash is playing</div>
<div>prefacing the songs</div>

<div>10/2</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mushy brain yesterday</div>
<div>Now, taking in new nico jaar. Intricate underneath but a layer of sort of..accessible dancey music. Thought often removing that top layer. Still, a not so close listen and it sounds like normal music. Not nico music. 'No' on repeat last night, while walking to casey's.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At casey's many people. Kamblamzah. Country music really the worst, everyone except for Frankie the southerner agreeing. Frankie. A name that makes me stop and ponder, explore the possibilities of the label.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Hey maybe I should feel more confident about myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>About once every few days: maybe I should call Stef now. Ah no now's not right. Would prefer beats on this walk etc etc.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Drinking whiskey. Not really tasting good but me I'm drinking drinking. Nika, a white and not Persian girl living in Chicago. She cute. She makin friends. She here for career fair, working for JP Morgan..</div>
<div>Table discussion of Kanye</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>monday morning. short hair (fresh cut), breakfast with the house pending.</div>
<div>that’s it. breakfast time so never finished.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now continuing, 9/13.</div>
<div>the body. a bit stiff. knees somewhat brittle. single speed bike? sitting all day at work, not even a little walk. and and - back to circuit workouts. feeling more fit, getting more lean - but also, for first time, questioning sustainability of workouts. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today. fresh from work. relatively early (6:30), nick out, mike + luke leaving. so, at home, sifting through closet, unloading into new mini dresser. mini. isiah rashad bumping. taking stream of music with me: walking in somerville. past sundry white people. a beautiful and calm day. in control, sort of. walking by Spoke like this is a nice date spot actually not really a bit too intimate like what would i do on a date maybe i should get back on tinder and try to find a date? thought dropped. feeling my body, strange to walk. it’s comfortable here. how quickly i’ve moved on from brooklyn. on the bike, the same thoughts, but somehow more true - or rather, verified - in motion.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>crackling sounds, from nico jaar. revisiting in light of ~nico jaar show in providence. adam in shower. stalling to synchronize dinner. and getting ~in touch with myself. because where have i been, days fading?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>days fading but it’s not so bad. i mean going by. not interminable. feeling relatively unproductive. but restlessness dissipating, some focus taking place.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night. eid mubarak calls - the intention. result: a single, 1.5 hour call to meral. and a missed call from adam. with meral, talking in depth about psych rotations. now supervising people. and shaayaan’s wedding, an amazing time. and me: back to somerville. new place. weird times with yaseen &amp; co. and other weird stories because i’m weird (&lt;- meral).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back in the house. working a bit on this twilio BS. </div>
<div>what do i need to spark me and energize me. i think i’m sharp, focused. etc. but need a spark.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then vash home around 10:30. us on the couch, talking about end of other people label. but nico show. and and. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a restless sleep.</div>

<div>Mon morning, waking up, thoughts racing. (Falling asleep, thoughts racing - the puffs of j precipitating thought avalanche. Work and Angela and Tanya and girls girls girls). Over and over in head, Isaiah Rashad. Roll up for the shqwa. And then .. Pop a xanny, make yo problems go away. Image of him with son on loop. (A short Isaiah rashad, one of the first things this morning. Tired start, shower, white button down, black slacks, Stan smith (not meshing as well as I expected but good enough / comfy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(Missed bus, so outside, in Arlington, writing. Sign up for kickboxing soon? Mass bjj directly across)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And thinking of: siavash's dominating personality. A quick question about sql table leading to him overtaking computer, trying solution (shouldn't have asked..). When walking into room, demanding complete attention. Would give anyone complete attention I suppose, but vash with enough self importance to demand that. And somehow roped into smoking, when really not feeling that. Tho maybe fact that Adam was too.</div>
<div>And dominating conversations - on phone, too. Like. Me, not dominant.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Sitting in living room, projecting videos for: Vince staples prima Donna, ras g, Isaiah, and then - curb. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The day Sunday mostly errands laundry cooking sort of thing. Phone calls to Tanya (for an hour, hmhm), Noor. Thanksgiving?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Saturday. Breakfast and: directly outside, to Davis. Nine bar, murakami. At nine bar, me awkward, half looking at guy w glasses who I've ordered from many times (shouldn't I at least ask how he's doing), half at coffee strains though ordering cold brew so no choice there. Next time less aekward, okay? Conversations about respective dogs, ahead of me. Their personality traits, tendencies, and recent life events. Still cannot lift the 'white people weird' opinion.</div>
<div>Beautiful outside.</div>
<div>Spanish speaking man asking for directions to 87 bus. Thinking: this is interesting. This man, stranger, asking me things. Murakami' world growing more complex..the book sort of about arbitrariness of attempting to derive meaning from life. Driven mainly by decision to be a certain type of person. Tho maybe murakami differs in this regard, characters seeming to fall into personality / tendency against will. Until 1pm, sitting out. Then: back in the house. To siavash's room, bringing bbq strategy and immediately: vibe, idea, enthusiasm killed. How he doesn't really want to get a car because then it's a thing. (Even tho, me driving an getting car). All these little qualifiers, told with a tone that undermined idea and framed it as burden inflicted on him. Personality dominance here: things imposed into vash, that serve others better, much less important. </div>
<div>Rant rant rant. Reminding self that: Siavash freee to do as he pleases, communicate whatever opinion about this bbq. Tho inconsiderate, I shouldn't be dominated by his opinion. (In a sense, his fault that personality is dominant, but in situation like this, not trying deliberately to dominate. In care ride too: quiet. Which is okay. But somewhat insulting, because the silence dominates and swallows our enthusiasm). </div>
<div>At u haul, filling propane tank and getting bbq advice from foresight-filled man filling his backup tank even though no bbq directly in sight.</div>
<div>(Now, bus stop. Woman, Indian perhaps, dressed in all purple. A wool type dress. Damn..)</div>
<div>Directly after returning from bbq endeavors, Siavash leaving. Discussing the nature of vibe kill, how not entirely mal-intentioned but still not cool. And quietly, getting to bbq work. A little bit of forced enthusiasm. Around 6 (time of bbq). Everything in place. Speakers blasting. Sitting on couch, a relaxed sigh. Casey, then Angela. 'Do we like X?'</div>

<div>a good tagline for..something?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today, a car to work. </div>
<div>yesterday. trip back. delirious but slightly coffee wired. in traffic. tim hecker playing, sunset. fantasies of: getting high (maybe), going on long bike ride, listening to music, and writing. (still quite feasible).</div>
<div>(did not follow through. ate / made lunch, did a lil work, then: presidential debate)</div>
<div>work more </div>
<div>but be alive</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>listening to beautiful anonymous. a slightly awkward call. and really didn’t go past surface. but still managed 1 hour conversation out of someone who isn’t that willing to give too much about themselves. </div>
<div>thinking: sometimes conversations just awkward (even with best conversationalist). and with this, a train of thoughts - socializing. when it’s meaningful to me. do i enjoy only when it’s ‘getting me somewhere’. like only talk about self if doing so will show this train of thought in new light.but then: the motivation to just share. share yourself, your thought. if i see this as privilege from others, should think the same about myself. </div>

<div>self categorization, of course</div>

<div>work today on a screen really all day</div>
<div>body going crazy</div>
<div>new room vibes</div>
<div>at work today:</div>
<div>revising same risk things blah blah documentation annoying erd shitty oracle software.</div>
<div>on the bus today, and bike, both ways. at home, riding in the super dark. cold. already. nico jar new album sounding beautiful.</div>
<div>and before: booma collective. blown away by beats vash has shown me.</div>
<div>needing to prepare resume for josh right right</div>
<div>at work  i need to need to get this done but really i don't</div>
<div>so horny lately</div>
<div>nico jaar wow.</div>
<div>for moments long moments today just giving myself up to the music</div>
<div>amazing an amazing feeling</div>
<div>with adam talking about our days. him: lunch at home again. dope dope like skipping school default dope. </div>
<div>i suppose i feel more secure with myself lately </div>
<div>invite a party with all of everyone we know, cool or not (with a light drawn somewhere) is the plan.</div>
<div>looking at these words sideways like it’s a graph. why no word wrap on this shit.</div>
<div>just slightly restless judging on gum i chew throughout day, coffee i drink.</div>
<div>how many states of mind have i been traveling through lately? </div>
<div>not spilling the words</div>
<div>the thoughts tho</div>
<div>these extremely visceral sounds from what siavash is playing</div>
<div>prefacing the songs</div>
<div>so incredibly passionately</div>
<div>body not good stiff</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/2</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mushy brain yesterday</div>
<div>Now, taking in new nico jaar. Intricate underneath but a layer of sort of..accessible dancey music. Thought often removing that top layer. Still, a not so close listen and it sounds like normal music. Not nico music. 'No' on repeat last night, while walking to casey's.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At casey's many people. Kamblamzah. Country music really the worst, everyone except for Frankie the southerner agreeing. Frankie. A name that makes me stop and ponder, explore the possibilities of the label.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Hey maybe I should feel more confident about myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>About once every few days: maybe I should call Stef now. Ah no now's not right. Would prefer beats on this walk etc etc.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Drinking whiskey. Not really tasting good but me I'm drinking drinking. Nika, a white and not Persian girl living in Chicago. She cute. She makin friends. She here for career fair, working for JP Morgan..</div>
<div>Table discussion of Kanye</div>
<div>Like I ordered an uberxl and Solomon kept accepting like fuck him. Girl maybe it's not Solomon's fault damn.</div>
<div>This crew of girls. Doing makeup and things</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Broken cartridge: song by ras g. In shattered voice: remember me, over and over. Beautiful.</div>
<div>
<div>now, 1369 shop. waiting for reef, early here to write. a girl with: baggy light jeans, adidas, glasses. ay. (actually talking to girl next to me like: you got the last table hehe)</div>
<div>yesterday. unable to focus b/c horny. and sort of like saving horniness for saturday night? as if it’s this force i can harness.. so like half working. running lazy queries. knowing exactly what numbers to pull but like really not feeling it (break down percentile by .1</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div>lately evaluating myself, and not just like writing externally enough (&lt;-pt and case).</div>
<div>Reef walking in after</div>
<div>3 hour musings</div>
<div>The summer things: engagement, Brooklyn move, Vancouver wedding.</div>
<div>These things. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/3</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today like looking at cargo pants</div>
<div>i mean that’s what i’m doing now</div>
<div>a good sort of giddy energy leaving work</div>
<div>design session, brainstorming w nick</div>
<div>him mainly driving, but an important distinction - my innovation - is that we should look at connectedness of procedures when considering a referral. like even if provider is going through a shitty referral, is there a better option? a ride in the bmw, old school. a cold air rushing through. light conversation, rap on shitty speakers. flatbush zombies at first. </div>
<div>super awake how me gonna gym</div>
<div>it’s okay let’s rely on manic energy because depressed energy last saturday, right?</div>
<div>no - more like, 2 cups of coffee today. whoops. why?</div>
<div>prescription meeting going well mainly.</div>
<div>bon hiver hi</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>to order:</div>

<div>9/12</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>monday morning. short hair (fresh cut), breakfast with the house pending.</div>
<div>that’s it. breakfast time so never finished.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now continuing, 9/13.</div>
<div>the body. a bit stiff. knees somewhat brittle. single speed bike? sitting all day at work, not even a little walk. and and - back to circuit workouts. feeling more fit, getting more lean - but also, for first time, questioning sustainability of workouts. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today. fresh from work. relatively early (6:30), nick out, mike + luke leaving. so, at home, sifting through closet, unloading into new mini dresser. mini. isiah rashad bumping. taking stream of music with me: walking in somerville. past sundry white people. a beautiful and calm day. in control, sort of. walking by Spoke like this is a nice date spot actually not really a bit too intimate like what would i do on a date maybe i should get back on tinder and try to find a date? thought dropped. feeling my body, strange to walk. it’s comfortable here. how quickly i’ve moved on from brooklyn. on the bike, the same thoughts, but somehow more true - or rather, verified - in motion.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>crackling sounds, from nico jaar. revisiting in light of ~nico jaar show in providence. adam in shower. stalling to synchronize dinner. and getting ~in touch with myself. because where have i been, days fading?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>days fading but it’s not so bad. i mean going by. not interminable. feeling relatively unproductive. but restlessness dissipating, some focus taking place.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night. eid mubarak calls - the intention. result: a single, 1.5 hour call to meral. and a missed call from adam. with meral, talking in depth about psych rotations. now supervising people. and shaayaan’s wedding, an amazing time. and me: back to somerville. new place. weird times with yaseen &amp; co. and other weird stories because i’m weird (&lt;- meral).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back in the house. working a bit on this twilio BS. </div>
<div>what do i need to spark me and energize me. i think i’m sharp, focused. etc. but need a spark.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then vash home around 10:30. us on the couch, talking about end of other people label. but nico show. and and. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a restless sleep.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lately in product land.  </div>
<div>(interrupted)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>9/17</div>
<div>1:15 post night chilling in davis hood</div>

<div>today sort of a productive day at work</div>
<div>finished wiki, progress on risk stuff</div>
<div>with guys all night</div>
<div>a cult of people who take new members and look at their stomachs</div>
<div>siavash laughing</div>
<div>siavash’s riveting, detailed gory story of surgery and all its drama</div>
<div>awake for most</div>
<div>image of it without processing, attached emotion or sentiment</div>

<div>sleeps like 3 hours / day</div>
<div>crazy life</div>
<div>why</div>
<div>then submarine videos</div>
<div>shockingly high text thinking of permutations for error god must be so much greater in 3d space though i suppose more open space less need to be precise but still comparatively crazy</div>
<div>writing and coming back to life feels good</div>
<div>now gaining focus feeling better about life and work overall </div>
<div>weird afternoons of 2 much coffee and weird snack and sitting and weird</div>
<div>today thinking about gym sustainability like hm maybe this is actually getting boring been doing this shit for a while </div>
<div>revamping interfaces for the company</div>
<div>like away from phone less and able to focus on activities for long periods of time and overall relatively stable</div>
<div>but hey i need a girl</div>
<div>and then yesterday - well before, let’s talk about before first - angela. dinner with angela. and like damn she’s cute but taken now.</div>
<div>speculating like if she’s interested or if that would work and what it would be like</div>
<div>guess i don’t know</div>
<div>then day after dinner with vira. area 4. dainty fancy semi-hipster industrial pharmaceutical vibes. her setting in quickly, boyfriend and all. good place, car, job. all that. about her brother, precocious and too cool for his age. life w me. social life. what’s that?</div>
<div>new room like dope</div>
<div>man should i can i be corporate forever</div>
<div>a couple joints tonight</div>
<div>outside talking about?&gt;</div>
<div>before siavash came in dramatically</div>
<div>with adam</div>
<div>comfort of living here, bbq speculation</div>
<div>contacts lately</div>
<div>loving the new rug</div>
<div>tasting dry bread with siavash, him wanting me to eat with some pb to experience what he experienced and me thinking  - what a demanding thing - complete and utter attention and domination of someone’s state of mind. with a conversation, the slightest amount of attention and brain space a privilege. </div>
<div>woo</div>
<div>good 2 write</div>
<div>adulthood</div>
<div>continue</div>
<div>brb later</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>9/19</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mon morning, waking up, thoughts racing. (Falling asleep, thoughts racing - the puffs of j precipitating thought avalanche. Work and Angela and Tanya and girls girls girls). Over and over in head, Isaiah Rashad. Roll up for the shqwa. And then .. Pop a xanny, make yo problems go away. Image of him with son on loop. (A short Isaiah rashad, one of the first things this morning. Tired start, shower, white button down, black slacks, Stan smith (not meshing as well as I expected but good enough / comfy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(Missed bus, so outside, in Arlington, writing. Sign up for kickboxing soon? Mass bjj directly across)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And thinking of: siavash's dominating personality. A quick question about sql table leading to him overtaking computer, trying solution (shouldn't have asked..). When walking into room, demanding complete attention. Would give anyone complete attention I suppose, but vash with enough self importance to demand that. And somehow roped into smoking, when really not feeling that. Tho maybe fact that Adam was too.</div>
<div>And dominating conversations - on phone, too. Like. Me, not dominant.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Sitting in living room, projecting videos for: Vince staples prima Donna, ras g, Isaiah, and then - curb. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The day Sunday mostly errands laundry cooking sort of thing. Phone calls to Tanya (for an hour, hmhm), Noor. Thanksgiving?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Saturday. Breakfast and: directly outside, to Davis. Nine bar, murakami. At nine bar, me awkward, half looking at guy w glasses who I've ordered from many times (shouldn't I at least ask how he's doing), half at coffee strains though ordering cold brew so no choice there. Next time less aekward, okay? Conversations about respective dogs, ahead of me. Their personality traits, tendencies, and recent life events. Still cannot lift the 'white people weird' opinion.</div>
<div>Beautiful outside.</div>
<div>Spanish speaking man asking for directions to 87 bus. Thinking: this is interesting. This man, stranger, asking me things. Murakami' world growing more complex..the book sort of about arbitrariness of attempting to derive meaning from life. Driven mainly by decision to be a certain type of person. Tho maybe murakami differs in this regard, characters seeming to fall into personality / tendency against will. Until 1pm, sitting out. Then: back in the house. To siavash's room, bringing bbq strategy and immediately: vibe, idea, enthusiasm killed. How he doesn't really want to get a car because then it's a thing. (Even tho, me driving an getting car). All these little qualifiers, told with a tone that undermined idea and framed it as burden inflicted on him. Personality dominance here: things imposed into vash, that serve others better, much less important. </div>
<div>Rant rant rant. Reminding self that: Siavash freee to do as he pleases, communicate whatever opinion about this bbq. Tho inconsiderate, I shouldn't be dominated by his opinion. (In a sense, his fault that personality is dominant, but in situation like this, not trying deliberately to dominate. In care ride too: quiet. Which is okay. But somewhat insulting, because the silence dominates and swallows our enthusiasm). </div>
<div>At u haul, filling propane tank and getting bbq advice from foresight-filled man filling his backup tank even though no bbq directly in sight.</div>
<div>(Now, bus stop. Woman, Indian perhaps, dressed in all purple. A wool type dress. Damn..)</div>
<div>Directly after returning from bbq endeavors, Siavash leaving. Discussing the nature of vibe kill, how not entirely mal-intentioned but still not cool. And quietly, getting to bbq work. A little bit of forced enthusiasm. Around 6 (time of bbq). Everything in place. Speakers blasting. Sitting on couch, a relaxed sigh. Casey, then Angela. 'Do we like X?'</div>

<div>tinder. not terribly unsuccessful lately.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking back to the summer. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work, mainly.</div>
<div>in response to ‘what’s on head’</div>
<div>stimulated and focused the whole day and not even sleeping well so perplexing</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>should sleep</div>

<div>#theotherhalf</div>
<div>a good tagline for..something?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today, a car to work. </div>
<div>yesterday. trip back. delirious but slightly coffee wired. in traffic. tim hecker playing, sunset. fantasies of: getting high (maybe), going on long bike ride, listening to music, and writing. (still quite feasible).</div>
<div>(did not follow through. ate / made lunch, did a lil work, then: presidential debate)</div>
<div>work more </div>
<div>but be alive</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>listening to beautiful anonymous. a slightly awkward call. and really didn’t go past surface. but still managed 1 hour conversation out of someone who isn’t that willing to give too much about themselves. </div>
<div>thinking: sometimes conversations just awkward (even with best conversationalist). and with this, a train of thoughts - socializing. when it’s meaningful to me. do i enjoy only when it’s ‘getting me somewhere’. like only talk about self if doing so will show this train of thought in new light.but then: the motivation to just share. share yourself, your thought. if i see this as privilege from others, should think the same about myself. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>self categorization, of course</div>

<div>work today on a screen really all day</div>
<div>body going crazy</div>
<div>new room vibes</div>
<div>at work today:</div>
<div>revising same risk things blah blah documentation annoying erd shitty oracle software.</div>
<div>on the bus today, and bike, both ways. at home, riding in the super dark. cold. already. nico jar new album sounding beautiful.</div>
<div>and before: booma collective. blown away by beats vash has shown me.</div>
<div>needing to prepare resume for josh right right</div>
<div>at work  i need to need to get this done but really i don't</div>
<div>so horny lately</div>
<div>nico jaar wow.</div>
<div>for moments long moments today just giving myself up to the music</div>
<div>amazing an amazing feeling</div>
<div>with adam talking about our days. him: lunch at home again. dope dope like skipping school default dope. </div>
<div>i suppose i feel more secure with myself lately </div>
<div>invite a party with all of everyone we know, cool or not (with a light drawn somewhere) is the plan.</div>
<div>looking at these words sideways like it’s a graph. why no word wrap on this shit.</div>
<div>just slightly restless judging on gum i chew throughout day, coffee i drink.</div>
<div>how many states of mind have i been traveling through lately? </div>
<div>not spilling the words</div>
<div>the thoughts tho</div>
<div>these extremely visceral sounds from what siavash is playing</div>
<div>prefacing the songs</div>
<div>so incredibly passionately</div>
<div>body not good stiff</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/2</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mushy brain yesterday</div>
<div>Now, taking in new nico jaar. Intricate underneath but a layer of sort of..accessible dancey music. Thought often removing that top layer. Still, a not so close listen and it sounds like normal music. Not nico music. 'No' on repeat last night, while walking to casey's.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At casey's many people. Kamblamzah. Country music really the worst, everyone except for Frankie the southerner agreeing. Frankie. A name that makes me stop and ponder, explore the possibilities of the label.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Hey maybe I should feel more confident about myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>About once every few days: maybe I should call Stef now. Ah no now's not right. Would prefer beats on this walk etc etc.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Drinking whiskey. Not really tasting good but me I'm drinking drinking. Nika, a white and not Persian girl living in Chicago. She cute. She makin friends. She here for career fair, working for JP Morgan..</div>
<div>Table discussion of Kanye</div>
<div>Like I ordered an uberxl and Solomon kept accepting like fuck him. Girl maybe it's not Solomon's fault damn.</div>
<div>This crew of girls. Doing makeup and things</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Broken cartridge: song by ras g. In shattered voice: remember me, over and over. Beautiful.</div>
<div>
<div>now, 1369 shop. waiting for reef, early here to write. a girl with: baggy light jeans, adidas, glasses. ay. (actually talking to girl next to me like: you got the last table hehe)</div>
<div>yesterday. unable to focus b/c horny. and sort of like saving horniness for saturday night? as if it’s this force i can harness.. so like half working. running lazy queries. knowing exactly what numbers to pull but like really not feeling it (break down percentile by .1</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div>lately evaluating myself, and not just like writing externally enough (&lt;-pt and case).</div>
<div>Reef walking in after</div>
<div>3 hour musings</div>
<div>The summer things: engagement, Brooklyn move, Vancouver wedding.</div>
<div>These things. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/3</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today like looking at cargo pants</div>
<div>i mean that’s what i’m doing now</div>
<div>a good sort of giddy energy leaving work</div>
<div>design session, brainstorming w nick</div>
<div>him mainly driving, but an important distinction - my innovation - is that we should look at connectedness of procedures when considering a referral. like even if provider is going through a shitty referral, is there a better option? a ride in the bmw, old school. a cold air rushing through. light conversation, rap on shitty speakers. flatbush zombies at first. </div>
<div>super awake how me gonna gym</div>
<div>it’s okay let’s rely on manic energy because depressed energy last saturday, right?</div>
<div>no - more like, 2 cups of coffee today. whoops. why?</div>
<div>prescription meeting going well mainly.</div>
<div>bon hiver hi</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>to order:</div>
<div>more patches, plain t's</div>
<div>cargo pants, jeans</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Thinking: what good would I make for kids if I had kids? Can't settle for my normal plain add quinoa shit</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/5</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>waiting for adam and writing </div>
<div>because doing, in a doing mode</div>
<div>but can’t do: work (too much, too late), reading (no graphs before bed please, and no new books), stretching (like, done), music (too transportive before sleep)</div>
<div>so doing. doing this.</div>
<div>today at work sort of fucking up. this silverton ED measure. running by year. but then switching to a while loop and aggregating the month by month. but like. not entirely blaming myself. not familiar enough with measure.</div>
<div>keyboard squeaking.</div>
<div>body stiff.</div>
<div>new mick jenkins and message of preaching love and how to do that.</div>
<div>i get it.</div>
<div>but like need to get the lyrics more. a conversation. </div>
<div>today at work a bit restless. this silverton ED stuff giving me something to do. but before that. staring at </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lately can’t poop without my phone</div>
<div>lately just one cup of coffee a day, reverting, and stomach feeling better</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>an ant on the keyboard. the new room. communicated through snapchat, family whatsapp group. spacebars on the door, like a little portal. not really, though if painted black, would be like this. and now blue japanese floor seating.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>for like 2 hours after work, touching up on elderly health diagram. okay looks better i suppose. though really just more minimal. like where did work time get put in to? i suppose centering and moving things slightly. with grid, and illustrator, probably much quicker.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>me as a technologist.</div>
<div>car rides with abhi. in the morning, providing a bagel (flip back to bagel shop, tall spunky blonde girl serving. rainbow plain bagels). look i’m so nice. beautiful and sunny out. (thinking, if i didn’t write about this moment right now - beautiful morning would have evaporated given the singular confined zone day presented otherwise). shower, oats, stretching at leisure. then: a shot of coffee, nico jar. outside, staring at the sun.</div>
<div>(watching a video of lil yachty’s dad talk about him - how did i stumble into this?)</div>
<div>wanting to: bail on vermont. because work mostly. like i need to get a start on design and prototyping and things and not be a robot.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>oh datathon ideas in the morning one sort of like routes to death if that’s even possible?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A scary content life in a suburb listening to steady beat rap all the time</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/9</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>‘observations from afar’ as some sort of name for a blog or something</div>
<div>observations from afar:</div>
<div>tinder girl, 70% positive, her on diesel. on date, also 70% positive. </div>
<div>some sort of somerville crazies like lady who seemed to accelerate into me then apologized well giving gratified, hyper-friendly (coked up?) type smile.</div>
<div>last night no socialization, just like chilling in house and watching solange videos for a little. then - sleep, followed by difficulty sleeping.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a duetan. most likely colorblind.</div>
<div>a personality portrait = new project.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>recognizing demeanors as evidence of making sense of the world by projecting own experiences (onto others, other things..)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>rotating shoes, people staring at rotating shoes</div>

<div>9/12</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>monday morning. short hair (fresh cut), breakfast with the house pending.</div>
<div>that’s it. breakfast time so never finished.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now continuing, 9/13.</div>
<div>the body. a bit stiff. knees somewhat brittle. single speed bike? sitting all day at work, not even a little walk. and and - back to circuit workouts. feeling more fit, getting more lean - but also, for first time, questioning sustainability of workouts. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today. fresh from work. relatively early (6:30), nick out, mike + luke leaving. so, at home, sifting through closet, unloading into new mini dresser. mini. isiah rashad bumping. taking stream of music with me: walking in somerville. past sundry white people. a beautiful and calm day. in control, sort of. walking by Spoke like this is a nice date spot actually not really a bit too intimate like what would i do on a date maybe i should get back on tinder and try to find a date? thought dropped. feeling my body, strange to walk. it’s comfortable here. how quickly i’ve moved on from brooklyn. on the bike, the same thoughts, but somehow more true - or rather, verified - in motion.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>crackling sounds, from nico jaar. revisiting in light of ~nico jaar show in providence. adam in shower. stalling to synchronize dinner. and getting ~in touch with myself. because where have i been, days fading?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>days fading but it’s not so bad. i mean going by. not interminable. feeling relatively unproductive. but restlessness dissipating, some focus taking place.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night. eid mubarak calls - the intention. result: a single, 1.5 hour call to meral. and a missed call from adam. with meral, talking in depth about psych rotations. now supervising people. and shaayaan’s wedding, an amazing time. and me: back to somerville. new place. weird times with yaseen &amp; co. and other weird stories because i’m weird (&lt;- meral).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back in the house. working a bit on this twilio BS. </div>
<div>what do i need to spark me and energize me. i think i’m sharp, focused. etc. but need a spark.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then vash home around 10:30. us on the couch, talking about end of other people label. but nico show. and and. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a restless sleep.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lately in product land.  </div>
<div>(interrupted)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>9/17</div>
<div>1:15 post night chilling in davis hood</div>

<div>thoughts of</div>
<div>feeling inspired inspiration okay now maybe i kinda wanna build things</div>
<div>today sort of a productive day at work</div>
<div>finished wiki, progress on risk stuff</div>
<div>with guys all night</div>
<div>a cult of people who take new members and look at their stomachs</div>
<div>siavash laughing</div>
<div>siavash’s riveting, detailed gory story of surgery and all its drama</div>
<div>awake for most</div>
<div>image of it without processing, attached emotion or sentiment</div>
<div>fascinating</div>
<div>his day</div>
<div>seafood ramen chilling party meeting japanese dude</div>
<div>and japanese dude manager of submarine</div>
<div>sleeps like 3 hours / day</div>
<div>crazy life</div>
<div>why</div>
<div>then submarine videos</div>
<div>shockingly high text thinking of permutations for error god must be so much greater in 3d space though i suppose more open space less need to be precise but still comparatively crazy</div>
<div>writing and coming back to life feels good</div>
<div>now gaining focus feeling better about life and work overall </div>
<div>weird afternoons of 2 much coffee and weird snack and sitting and weird</div>
<div>today thinking about gym sustainability like hm maybe this is actually getting boring been doing this shit for a while </div>
<div>revamping interfaces for the company</div>
<div>like away from phone less and able to focus on activities for long periods of time and overall relatively stable</div>
<div>but hey i need a girl</div>
<div>and then yesterday - well before, let’s talk about before first - angela. dinner with angela. and like damn she’s cute but taken now.</div>
<div>speculating like if she’s interested or if that would work and what it would be like</div>
<div>guess i don’t know</div>
<div>then day after dinner with vira. area 4. dainty fancy semi-hipster industrial pharmaceutical vibes. her setting in quickly, boyfriend and all. good place, car, job. all that. about her brother, precocious and too cool for his age. life w me. social life. what’s that?</div>
<div>new room like dope</div>
<div>man should i can i be corporate forever</div>
<div>a couple joints tonight</div>
<div>outside talking about?&gt;</div>
<div>before siavash came in dramatically</div>
<div>with adam</div>
<div>comfort of living here, bbq speculation</div>
<div>contacts lately</div>
<div>loving the new rug</div>
<div>tasting dry bread with siavash, him wanting me to eat with some pb to experience what he experienced and me thinking  - what a demanding thing - complete and utter attention and domination of someone’s state of mind. with a conversation, the slightest amount of attention and brain space a privilege. </div>
<div>woo</div>
<div>good 2 write</div>
<div>adulthood</div>
<div>continue</div>
<div>brb later</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>9/19</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mon morning, waking up, thoughts racing. (Falling asleep, thoughts racing - the puffs of j precipitating thought avalanche. Work and Angela and Tanya and girls girls girls). Over and over in head, Isaiah Rashad. Roll up for the shqwa. And then .. Pop a xanny, make yo problems go away. Image of him with son on loop. (A short Isaiah rashad, one of the first things this morning. Tired start, shower, white button down, black slacks, Stan smith (not meshing as well as I expected but good enough / comfy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(Missed bus, so outside, in Arlington, writing. Sign up for kickboxing soon? Mass bjj directly across)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And thinking of: siavash's dominating personality. A quick question about sql table leading to him overtaking computer, trying solution (shouldn't have asked..). When walking into room, demanding complete attention. Would give anyone complete attention I suppose, but vash with enough self importance to demand that. And somehow roped into smoking, when really not feeling that. Tho maybe fact that Adam was too.</div>
<div>And dominating conversations - on phone, too. Like. Me, not dominant.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Sitting in living room, projecting videos for: Vince staples prima Donna, ras g, Isaiah, and then - curb. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The day Sunday mostly errands laundry cooking sort of thing. Phone calls to Tanya (for an hour, hmhm), Noor. Thanksgiving?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Saturday. Breakfast and: directly outside, to Davis. Nine bar, murakami. At nine bar, me awkward, half looking at guy w glasses who I've ordered from many times (shouldn't I at least ask how he's doing), half at coffee strains though ordering cold brew so no choice there. Next time less aekward, okay? Conversations about respective dogs, ahead of me. Their personality traits, tendencies, and recent life events. Still cannot lift the 'white people weird' opinion.</div>
<div>Beautiful outside.</div>
<div>Spanish speaking man asking for directions to 87 bus. Thinking: this is interesting. This man, stranger, asking me things. Murakami' world growing more complex..the book sort of about arbitrariness of attempting to derive meaning from life. Driven mainly by decision to be a certain type of person. Tho maybe murakami differs in this regard, characters seeming to fall into personality / tendency against will. Until 1pm, sitting out. Then: back in the house. To siavash's room, bringing bbq strategy and immediately: vibe, idea, enthusiasm killed. How he doesn't really want to get a car because then it's a thing. (Even tho, me driving an getting car). All these little qualifiers, told with a tone that undermined idea and framed it as burden inflicted on him. Personality dominance here: things imposed into vash, that serve others better, much less important. </div>
<div>Rant rant rant. Reminding self that: Siavash freee to do as he pleases, communicate whatever opinion about this bbq. Tho inconsiderate, I shouldn't be dominated by his opinion. (In a sense, his fault that personality is dominant, but in situation like this, not trying deliberately to dominate. In care ride too: quiet. Which is okay. But somewhat insulting, because the silence dominates and swallows our enthusiasm). </div>
<div>At u haul, filling propane tank and getting bbq advice from foresight-filled man filling his backup tank even though no bbq directly in sight.</div>
<div>(Now, bus stop. Woman, Indian perhaps, dressed in all purple. A wool type dress. Damn..)</div>
<div>Directly after returning from bbq endeavors, Siavash leaving. Discussing the nature of vibe kill, how not entirely mal-intentioned but still not cool. And quietly, getting to bbq work. A little bit of forced enthusiasm. Around 6 (time of bbq). Everything in place. Speakers blasting. Sitting on couch, a relaxed sigh. Casey, then Angela. 'Do we like X?'</div>

<div>a good tagline for..something?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today, a car to work. </div>
<div>yesterday. trip back. delirious but slightly coffee wired. in traffic. tim hecker playing, sunset. fantasies of: getting high (maybe), going on long bike ride, listening to music, and writing. (still quite feasible).</div>
<div>(did not follow through. ate / made lunch, did a lil work, then: presidential debate)</div>
<div>work more </div>
<div>but be alive</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>listening to beautiful anonymous. a slightly awkward call. and really didn’t go past surface. but still managed 1 hour conversation out of someone who isn’t that willing to give too much about themselves. </div>
<div>thinking: sometimes conversations just awkward (even with best conversationalist). and with this, a train of thoughts - socializing. when it’s meaningful to me. do i enjoy only when it’s ‘getting me somewhere’. like only talk about self if doing so will show this train of thought in new light.but then: the motivation to just share. share yourself, your thought. if i see this as privilege from others, should think the same about myself. </div>

<div>self categorization, of course</div>

<div>new room vibes</div>
<div>at work today:</div>
<div>revising same risk things blah blah documentation annoying erd shitty oracle software.</div>
<div>on the bus today, and bike, both ways. at home, riding in the super dark. cold. already. nico jar new album sounding beautiful.</div>
<div>and before: booma collective. blown away by beats vash has shown me.</div>
<div>needing to prepare resume for josh right right</div>
<div>at work  i need to need to get this done but really i don't</div>
<div>so horny lately</div>
<div>nico jaar wow.</div>
<div>for moments long moments today just giving myself up to the music</div>
<div>amazing an amazing feeling</div>
<div>with adam talking about our days. him: lunch at home again. dope dope like skipping school default dope. </div>
<div>i suppose i feel more secure with myself lately </div>
<div>invite a party with all of everyone we know, cool or not (with a light drawn somewhere) is the plan.</div>
<div>looking at these words sideways like it’s a graph. why no word wrap on this shit.</div>
<div>just slightly restless judging on gum i chew throughout day, coffee i drink.</div>
<div>how many states of mind have i been traveling through lately? </div>
<div>not spilling the words</div>
<div>the thoughts tho</div>
<div>these extremely visceral sounds from what siavash is playing</div>
<div>prefacing the songs</div>
<div>so incredibly passionately</div>
<div>body not good stiff</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/2</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mushy brain yesterday</div>
<div>Now, taking in new nico jaar. Intricate underneath but a layer of sort of..accessible dancey music. Thought often removing that top layer. Still, a not so close listen and it sounds like normal music. Not nico music. 'No' on repeat last night, while walking to casey's.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At casey's many people. Kamblamzah. Country music really the worst, everyone except for Frankie the southerner agreeing. Frankie. A name that makes me stop and ponder, explore the possibilities of the label.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Hey maybe I should feel more confident about myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>About once every few days: maybe I should call Stef now. Ah no now's not right. Would prefer beats on this walk etc etc.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Drinking whiskey. Not really tasting good but me I'm drinking drinking. Nika, a white and not Persian girl living in Chicago. She cute. She makin friends. She here for career fair, working for JP Morgan..</div>
<div>Table discussion of Kanye</div>
<div>Like I ordered an uberxl and Solomon kept accepting like fuck him. Girl maybe it's not Solomon's fault damn.</div>
<div>This crew of girls. Doing makeup and things</div>

<div>3 hour musings</div>
<div>The summer things: engagement, Brooklyn move, Vancouver wedding.</div>
<div>These things. </div>
<div>Religiousness in three phases, or more: religious, atheist, rejecting label of atheist, rejecting idea that religion and success can not coexist. Instigating the last idea: play called disgraced. Pakistani, originally Muslim man who (synonym for reject)s his heritage, thinking it detracts from his success. From vision of self.

<div><br/></div>
<div>monday morning. short hair (fresh cut), breakfast with the house pending.</div>
<div>that’s it. breakfast time so never finished.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now continuing, 9/13.</div>
<div>the body. a bit stiff. knees somewhat brittle. single speed bike? sitting all day at work, not even a little walk. and and - back to circuit workouts. feeling more fit, getting more lean - but also, for first time, questioning sustainability of workouts. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today. fresh from work. relatively early (6:30), nick out, mike + luke leaving. so, at home, sifting through closet, unloading into new mini dresser. mini. isiah rashad bumping. taking stream of music with me: walking in somerville. past sundry white people. a beautiful and calm day. in control, sort of. walking by Spoke like this is a nice date spot actually not really a bit too intimate like what would i do on a date maybe i should get back on tinder and try to find a date? thought dropped. feeling my body, strange to walk. it’s comfortable here. how quickly i’ve moved on from brooklyn. on the bike, the same thoughts, but somehow more true - or rather, verified - in motion.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>crackling sounds, from nico jaar. revisiting in light of ~nico jaar show in providence. adam in shower. stalling to synchronize dinner. and getting ~in touch with myself. because where have i been, days fading?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>days fading but it’s not so bad. i mean going by. not interminable. feeling relatively unproductive. but restlessness dissipating, some focus taking place.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night. eid mubarak calls - the intention. result: a single, 1.5 hour call to meral. and a missed call from adam. with meral, talking in depth about psych rotations. now supervising people. and shaayaan’s wedding, an amazing time. and me: back to somerville. new place. weird times with yaseen &amp; co. and other weird stories because i’m weird (&lt;- meral).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back in the house. working a bit on this twilio BS. </div>
<div>what do i need to spark me and energize me. i think i’m sharp, focused. etc. but need a spark.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then vash home around 10:30. us on the couch, talking about end of other people label. but nico show. and and. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a restless sleep.</div>

<div>shockingly high text thinking of permutations for error god must be so much greater in 3d space though i suppose more open space less need to be precise but still comparatively crazy</div>
<div>writing and coming back to life feels good</div>
<div>now gaining focus feeling better about life and work overall </div>
<div>weird afternoons of 2 much coffee and weird snack and sitting and weird</div>
<div>today thinking about gym sustainability like hm maybe this is actually getting boring been doing this shit for a while </div>
<div>revamping interfaces for the company</div>

<div>but hey i need a girl</div>
<div>and then yesterday - well before, let’s talk about before first - angela. dinner with angela. and like damn she’s cute but taken now.</div>
<div>speculating like if she’s interested or if that would work and what it would be like</div>

<div>with adam</div>
<div>comfort of living here, bbq speculation</div>
<div>contacts lately</div>
<div>loving the new rug</div>
<div>tasting dry bread with siavash, him wanting me to eat with some pb to experience what he experienced and me thinking  - what a demanding thing - complete and utter attention and domination of someone’s state of mind. with a conversation, the slightest amount of attention and brain space a privilege. </div>
<div>woo</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>Mon morning, waking up, thoughts racing. (Falling asleep, thoughts racing - the puffs of j precipitating thought avalanche. Work and Angela and Tanya and girls girls girls). Over and over in head, Isaiah Rashad. Roll up for the shqwa. And then .. Pop a xanny, make yo problems go away. Image of him with son on loop. (A short Isaiah rashad, one of the first things this morning. Tired start, shower, white button down, black slacks, Stan smith (not meshing as well as I expected but good enough / comfy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(Missed bus, so outside, in Arlington, writing. Sign up for kickboxing soon? Mass bjj directly across)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And thinking of: siavash's dominating personality. A quick question about sql table leading to him overtaking computer, trying solution (shouldn't have asked..). When walking into room, demanding complete attention. Would give anyone complete attention I suppose, but vash with enough self importance to demand that. And somehow roped into smoking, when really not feeling that. Tho maybe fact that Adam was too.</div>
<div>And dominating conversations - on phone, too. Like. Me, not dominant.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Sitting in living room, projecting videos for: Vince staples prima Donna, ras g, Isaiah, and then - curb. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The day Sunday mostly errands laundry cooking sort of thing. Phone calls to Tanya (for an hour, hmhm), Noor. Thanksgiving?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Saturday. Breakfast and: directly outside, to Davis. Nine bar, murakami. At nine bar, me awkward, half looking at guy w glasses who I've ordered from many times (shouldn't I at least ask how he's doing), half at coffee strains though ordering cold brew so no choice there. Next time less aekward, okay? Conversations about respective dogs, ahead of me. Their personality traits, tendencies, and recent life events. Still cannot lift the 'white people weird' opinion.</div>
<div>Beautiful outside.</div>
<div>Spanish speaking man asking for directions to 87 bus. Thinking: this is interesting. This man, stranger, asking me things. Murakami' world growing more complex..the book sort of about arbitrariness of attempting to derive meaning from life. Driven mainly by decision to be a certain type of person. Tho maybe murakami differs in this regard, characters seeming to fall into personality / tendency against will. Until 1pm, sitting out. Then: back in the house. To siavash's room, bringing bbq strategy and immediately: vibe, idea, enthusiasm killed. How he doesn't really want to get a car because then it's a thing. (Even tho, me driving an getting car). All these little qualifiers, told with a tone that undermined idea and framed it as burden inflicted on him. Personality dominance here: things imposed into vash, that serve others better, much less important. </div>
<div>Rant rant rant. Reminding self that: Siavash freee to do as he pleases, communicate whatever opinion about this bbq. Tho inconsiderate, I shouldn't be dominated by his opinion. (In a sense, his fault that personality is dominant, but in situation like this, not trying deliberately to dominate. In care ride too: quiet. Which is okay. But somewhat insulting, because the silence dominates and swallows our enthusiasm). </div>
<div>At u haul, filling propane tank and getting bbq advice from foresight-filled man filling his backup tank even though no bbq directly in sight.</div>
<div>(Now, bus stop. Woman, Indian perhaps, dressed in all purple. A wool type dress. Damn..)</div>
<div>Directly after returning from bbq endeavors, Siavash leaving. Discussing the nature of vibe kill, how not entirely mal-intentioned but still not cool. And quietly, getting to bbq work. A little bit of forced enthusiasm. Around 6 (time of bbq). Everything in place. Speakers blasting. Sitting on couch, a relaxed sigh. Casey, then Angela. 'Do we like X?'</div>

<div>today, a car to work. </div>
<div>yesterday. trip back. delirious but slightly coffee wired. in traffic. tim hecker playing, sunset. fantasies of: getting high (maybe), going on long bike ride, listening to music, and writing. (still quite feasible).</div>
<div>(did not follow through. ate / made lunch, did a lil work, then: presidential debate)</div>
<div>work more </div>
<div>but be alive</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>listening to beautiful anonymous. a slightly awkward call. and really didn’t go past surface. but still managed 1 hour conversation out of someone who isn’t that willing to give too much about themselves. </div>
<div>thinking: sometimes conversations just awkward (even with best conversationalist). and with this, a train of thoughts - socializing. when it’s meaningful to me. do i enjoy only when it’s ‘getting me somewhere’. like only talk about self if doing so will show this train of thought in new light.but then: the motivation to just share. share yourself, your thought. if i see this as privilege from others, should think the same about myself. </div>

<div>self categorization, of course</div>

<div>work today on a screen really all day</div>
<div>body going crazy</div>
<div>new room vibes</div>
<div>at work today:</div>
<div>revising same risk things blah blah documentation annoying erd shitty oracle software.</div>
<div>on the bus today, and bike, both ways. at home, riding in the super dark. cold. already. nico jar new album sounding beautiful.</div>
<div>and before: booma collective. blown away by beats vash has shown me.</div>
<div>needing to prepare resume for josh right right</div>
<div>at work  i need to need to get this done but really i don't</div>
<div>so horny lately</div>
<div>nico jaar wow.</div>
<div>for moments long moments today just giving myself up to the music</div>
<div>amazing an amazing feeling</div>
<div>with adam talking about our days. him: lunch at home again. dope dope like skipping school default dope. </div>
<div>i suppose i feel more secure with myself lately </div>
<div>invite a party with all of everyone we know, cool or not (with a light drawn somewhere) is the plan.</div>
<div>looking at these words sideways like it’s a graph. why no word wrap on this shit.</div>
<div>just slightly restless judging on gum i chew throughout day, coffee i drink.</div>
<div>how many states of mind have i been traveling through lately? </div>
<div>not spilling the words</div>
<div>the thoughts tho</div>
<div>these extremely visceral sounds from what siavash is playing</div>
<div>prefacing the songs</div>
<div>so incredibly passionately</div>
<div>body not good stiff</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/2</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mushy brain yesterday</div>
<div>Now, taking in new nico jaar. Intricate underneath but a layer of sort of..accessible dancey music. Thought often removing that top layer. Still, a not so close listen and it sounds like normal music. Not nico music. 'No' on repeat last night, while walking to casey's.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At casey's many people. Kamblamzah. Country music really the worst, everyone except for Frankie the southerner agreeing. Frankie. A name that makes me stop and ponder, explore the possibilities of the label.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Hey maybe I should feel more confident about myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>About once every few days: maybe I should call Stef now. Ah no now's not right. Would prefer beats on this walk etc etc.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Drinking whiskey. Not really tasting good but me I'm drinking drinking. Nika, a white and not Persian girl living in Chicago. She cute. She makin friends. She here for career fair, working for JP Morgan..</div>
<div>Table discussion of Kanye</div>
<div>Like I ordered an uberxl and Solomon kept accepting like fuck him. Girl maybe it's not Solomon's fault damn.</div>
<div>This crew of girls. Doing makeup and things</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Broken cartridge: song by ras g. In shattered voice: remember me, over and over. Beautiful.</div>
<div>
<div>now, 1369 shop. waiting for reef, early here to write. a girl with: baggy light jeans, adidas, glasses. ay. (actually talking to girl next to me like: you got the last table hehe)</div>
<div>yesterday. unable to focus b/c horny. and sort of like saving horniness for saturday night? as if it’s this force i can harness.. so like half working. running lazy queries. knowing exactly what numbers to pull but like really not feeling it (break down percentile by .1</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div>lately evaluating myself, and not just like writing externally enough (&lt;-pt and case).</div>
<div>Reef walking in after</div>
<div>3 hour musings</div>
<div>The summer things: engagement, Brooklyn move, Vancouver wedding.</div>
<div>These things. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/3</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today like looking at cargo pants</div>
<div>i mean that’s what i’m doing now</div>
<div>a good sort of giddy energy leaving work</div>
<div>design session, brainstorming w nick</div>
<div>him mainly driving, but an important distinction - my innovation - is that we should look at connectedness of procedures when considering a referral. like even if provider is going through a shitty referral, is there a better option? a ride in the bmw, old school. a cold air rushing through. light conversation, rap on shitty speakers. flatbush zombies at first. </div>
<div>super awake how me gonna gym</div>
<div>it’s okay let’s rely on manic energy because depressed energy last saturday, right?</div>
<div>no - more like, 2 cups of coffee today. whoops. why?</div>
<div>prescription meeting going well mainly.</div>
<div>bon hiver hi</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>to order:</div>

<div>9/12</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>monday morning. short hair (fresh cut), breakfast with the house pending.</div>
<div>that’s it. breakfast time so never finished.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now continuing, 9/13.</div>
<div>the body. a bit stiff. knees somewhat brittle. single speed bike? sitting all day at work, not even a little walk. and and - back to circuit workouts. feeling more fit, getting more lean - but also, for first time, questioning sustainability of workouts. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today. fresh from work. relatively early (6:30), nick out, mike + luke leaving. so, at home, sifting through closet, unloading into new mini dresser. mini. isiah rashad bumping. taking stream of music with me: walking in somerville. past sundry white people. a beautiful and calm day. in control, sort of. walking by Spoke like this is a nice date spot actually not really a bit too intimate like what would i do on a date maybe i should get back on tinder and try to find a date? thought dropped. feeling my body, strange to walk. it’s comfortable here. how quickly i’ve moved on from brooklyn. on the bike, the same thoughts, but somehow more true - or rather, verified - in motion.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>crackling sounds, from nico jaar. revisiting in light of ~nico jaar show in providence. adam in shower. stalling to synchronize dinner. and getting ~in touch with myself. because where have i been, days fading?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>days fading but it’s not so bad. i mean going by. not interminable. feeling relatively unproductive. but restlessness dissipating, some focus taking place.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night. eid mubarak calls - the intention. result: a single, 1.5 hour call to meral. and a missed call from adam. with meral, talking in depth about psych rotations. now supervising people. and shaayaan’s wedding, an amazing time. and me: back to somerville. new place. weird times with yaseen &amp; co. and other weird stories because i’m weird (&lt;- meral).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back in the house. working a bit on this twilio BS. </div>
<div>what do i need to spark me and energize me. i think i’m sharp, focused. etc. but need a spark.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then vash home around 10:30. us on the couch, talking about end of other people label. but nico show. and and. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a restless sleep.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lately in product land.  </div>
<div>(interrupted)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>9/17</div>
<div>1:15 post night chilling in davis hood</div>
<div>sucked into tinder</div>
<div>one reply and one robot that at first seemed real?</div>
<div>re-examining website</div>
<div>thoughts of</div>
<div>feeling inspired inspiration okay now maybe i kinda wanna build things</div>
<div>today sort of a productive day at work</div>
<div>finished wiki, progress on risk stuff</div>
<div>with guys all night</div>
<div>a cult of people who take new members and look at their stomachs</div>
<div>siavash laughing</div>
<div>siavash’s riveting, detailed gory story of surgery and all its drama</div>
<div>awake for most</div>
<div>image of it without processing, attached emotion or sentiment</div>
<div>fascinating</div>
<div>his day</div>
<div>seafood ramen chilling party meeting japanese dude</div>
<div>and japanese dude manager of submarine</div>
<div>sleeps like 3 hours / day</div>
<div>crazy life</div>
<div>why</div>
<div>then submarine videos</div>
<div>shockingly high text thinking of permutations for error god must be so much greater in 3d space though i suppose more open space less need to be precise but still comparatively crazy</div>
<div>writing and coming back to life feels good</div>
<div>now gaining focus feeling better about life and work overall </div>
<div>weird afternoons of 2 much coffee and weird snack and sitting and weird</div>
<div>today thinking about gym sustainability like hm maybe this is actually getting boring been doing this shit for a while </div>
<div>revamping interfaces for the company</div>
<div>like away from phone less and able to focus on activities for long periods of time and overall relatively stable</div>
<div>but hey i need a girl</div>
<div>and then yesterday - well before, let’s talk about before first - angela. dinner with angela. and like damn she’s cute but taken now.</div>
<div>speculating like if she’s interested or if that would work and what it would be like</div>
<div>guess i don’t know</div>
<div>then day after dinner with vira. area 4. dainty fancy semi-hipster industrial pharmaceutical vibes. her setting in quickly, boyfriend and all. good place, car, job. all that. about her brother, precocious and too cool for his age. life w me. social life. what’s that?</div>
<div>new room like dope</div>
<div>man should i can i be corporate forever</div>
<div>a couple joints tonight</div>
<div>outside talking about?&gt;</div>
<div>before siavash came in dramatically</div>
<div>with adam</div>
<div>comfort of living here, bbq speculation</div>
<div>contacts lately</div>
<div>loving the new rug</div>
<div>tasting dry bread with siavash, him wanting me to eat with some pb to experience what he experienced and me thinking  - what a demanding thing - complete and utter attention and domination of someone’s state of mind. with a conversation, the slightest amount of attention and brain space a privilege. </div>
<div>woo</div>
<div>good 2 write</div>
<div>adulthood</div>
<div>continue</div>
<div>brb later</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>9/19</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mon morning, waking up, thoughts racing. (Falling asleep, thoughts racing - the puffs of j precipitating thought avalanche. Work and Angela and Tanya and girls girls girls). Over and over in head, Isaiah Rashad. Roll up for the shqwa. And then .. Pop a xanny, make yo problems go away. Image of him with son on loop. (A short Isaiah rashad, one of the first things this morning. Tired start, shower, white button down, black slacks, Stan smith (not meshing as well as I expected but good enough / comfy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(Missed bus, so outside, in Arlington, writing. Sign up for kickboxing soon? Mass bjj directly across)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And thinking of: siavash's dominating personality. A quick question about sql table leading to him overtaking computer, trying solution (shouldn't have asked..). When walking into room, demanding complete attention. Would give anyone complete attention I suppose, but vash with enough self importance to demand that. And somehow roped into smoking, when really not feeling that. Tho maybe fact that Adam was too.</div>
<div>And dominating conversations - on phone, too. Like. Me, not dominant.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Sitting in living room, projecting videos for: Vince staples prima Donna, ras g, Isaiah, and then - curb. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The day Sunday mostly errands laundry cooking sort of thing. Phone calls to Tanya (for an hour, hmhm), Noor. Thanksgiving?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Saturday. Breakfast and: directly outside, to Davis. Nine bar, murakami. At nine bar, me awkward, half looking at guy w glasses who I've ordered from many times (shouldn't I at least ask how he's doing), half at coffee strains though ordering cold brew so no choice there. Next time less aekward, okay? Conversations about respective dogs, ahead of me. Their personality traits, tendencies, and recent life events. Still cannot lift the 'white people weird' opinion.</div>
<div>Beautiful outside.</div>
<div>Spanish speaking man asking for directions to 87 bus. Thinking: this is interesting. This man, stranger, asking me things. Murakami' world growing more complex..the book sort of about arbitrariness of attempting to derive meaning from life. Driven mainly by decision to be a certain type of person. Tho maybe murakami differs in this regard, characters seeming to fall into personality / tendency against will. Until 1pm, sitting out. Then: back in the house. To siavash's room, bringing bbq strategy and immediately: vibe, idea, enthusiasm killed. How he doesn't really want to get a car because then it's a thing. (Even tho, me driving an getting car). All these little qualifiers, told with a tone that undermined idea and framed it as burden inflicted on him. Personality dominance here: things imposed into vash, that serve others better, much less important. </div>
<div>Rant rant rant. Reminding self that: Siavash freee to do as he pleases, communicate whatever opinion about this bbq. Tho inconsiderate, I shouldn't be dominated by his opinion. (In a sense, his fault that personality is dominant, but in situation like this, not trying deliberately to dominate. In care ride too: quiet. Which is okay. But somewhat insulting, because the silence dominates and swallows our enthusiasm). </div>
<div>At u haul, filling propane tank and getting bbq advice from foresight-filled man filling his backup tank even though no bbq directly in sight.</div>
<div>(Now, bus stop. Woman, Indian perhaps, dressed in all purple. A wool type dress. Damn..)</div>
<div>Directly after returning from bbq endeavors, Siavash leaving. Discussing the nature of vibe kill, how not entirely mal-intentioned but still not cool. And quietly, getting to bbq work. A little bit of forced enthusiasm. Around 6 (time of bbq). Everything in place. Speakers blasting. Sitting on couch, a relaxed sigh. Casey, then Angela. 'Do we like X?'</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Cowboy bepop</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Journal. Thoughts spilling but not eloquently. Get back on it..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>9/20</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This morning a half hour snooze I don't remember</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Last night: Adam resonating over personality episode of invisibilia. Resonating. Personality as fluid. Directing conversation to indecisiveness, career.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Morning. Death grips the main motivation behind 3 mile run. Leisurely coffee, ny times after. </div>
<div><br/></div>

<div>today, a car to work. </div>
<div>yesterday. trip back. delirious but slightly coffee wired. in traffic. tim hecker playing, sunset. fantasies of: getting high (maybe), going on long bike ride, listening to music, and writing. (still quite feasible).</div>
<div>(did not follow through. ate / made lunch, did a lil work, then: presidential debate)</div>
<div>work more </div>
<div>but be alive</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>listening to beautiful anonymous. a slightly awkward call. and really didn’t go past surface. but still managed 1 hour conversation out of someone who isn’t that willing to give too much about themselves. </div>
<div>thinking: sometimes conversations just awkward (even with best conversationalist). and with this, a train of thoughts - socializing. when it’s meaningful to me. do i enjoy only when it’s ‘getting me somewhere’. like only talk about self if doing so will show this train of thought in new light.but then: the motivation to just share. share yourself, your thought. if i see this as privilege from others, should think the same about myself. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>self categorization, of course</div>

<div>work today on a screen really all day</div>
<div>body going crazy</div>
<div>new room vibes</div>
<div>at work today:</div>
<div>revising same risk things blah blah documentation annoying erd shitty oracle software.</div>
<div>on the bus today, and bike, both ways. at home, riding in the super dark. cold. already. nico jar new album sounding beautiful.</div>
<div>and before: booma collective. blown away by beats vash has shown me.</div>
<div>needing to prepare resume for josh right right</div>
<div>at work  i need to need to get this done but really i don't</div>
<div>so horny lately</div>
<div>nico jaar wow.</div>
<div>for moments long moments today just giving myself up to the music</div>
<div>amazing an amazing feeling</div>
<div>with adam talking about our days. him: lunch at home again. dope dope like skipping school default dope. </div>
<div>i suppose i feel more secure with myself lately </div>
<div>invite a party with all of everyone we know, cool or not (with a light drawn somewhere) is the plan.</div>
<div>looking at these words sideways like it’s a graph. why no word wrap on this shit.</div>
<div>just slightly restless judging on gum i chew throughout day, coffee i drink.</div>
<div>how many states of mind have i been traveling through lately? </div>
<div>not spilling the words</div>
<div>the thoughts tho</div>
<div>these extremely visceral sounds from what siavash is playing</div>
<div>prefacing the songs</div>
<div>so incredibly passionately</div>
<div>body not good stiff</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/2</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mushy brain yesterday</div>
<div>Now, taking in new nico jaar. Intricate underneath but a layer of sort of..accessible dancey music. Thought often removing that top layer. Still, a not so close listen and it sounds like normal music. Not nico music. 'No' on repeat last night, while walking to casey's.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At casey's many people. Kamblamzah. Country music really the worst, everyone except for Frankie the southerner agreeing. Frankie. A name that makes me stop and ponder, explore the possibilities of the label.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Hey maybe I should feel more confident about myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>About once every few days: maybe I should call Stef now. Ah no now's not right. Would prefer beats on this walk etc etc.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Drinking whiskey. Not really tasting good but me I'm drinking drinking. Nika, a white and not Persian girl living in Chicago. She cute. She makin friends. She here for career fair, working for JP Morgan..</div>
<div>Table discussion of Kanye</div>
<div>Like I ordered an uberxl and Solomon kept accepting like fuck him. Girl maybe it's not Solomon's fault damn.</div>
<div>This crew of girls. Doing makeup and things</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Broken cartridge: song by ras g. In shattered voice: remember me, over and over. Beautiful.</div>
<div>
<div>now, 1369 shop. waiting for reef, early here to write. a girl with: baggy light jeans, adidas, glasses. ay. (actually talking to girl next to me like: you got the last table hehe)</div>
<div>yesterday. unable to focus b/c horny. and sort of like saving horniness for saturday night? as if it’s this force i can harness.. so like half working. running lazy queries. knowing exactly what numbers to pull but like really not feeling it (break down percentile by .1</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div>lately evaluating myself, and not just like writing externally enough (&lt;-pt and case).</div>
<div>Reef walking in after</div>
<div>3 hour musings</div>
<div>The summer things: engagement, Brooklyn move, Vancouver wedding.</div>
<div>These things. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/3</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today like looking at cargo pants</div>
<div>i mean that’s what i’m doing now</div>
<div>a good sort of giddy energy leaving work</div>
<div>design session, brainstorming w nick</div>
<div>him mainly driving, but an important distinction - my innovation - is that we should look at connectedness of procedures when considering a referral. like even if provider is going through a shitty referral, is there a better option? a ride in the bmw, old school. a cold air rushing through. light conversation, rap on shitty speakers. flatbush zombies at first. </div>
<div>super awake how me gonna gym</div>
<div>it’s okay let’s rely on manic energy because depressed energy last saturday, right?</div>
<div>no - more like, 2 cups of coffee today. whoops. why?</div>
<div>prescription meeting going well mainly.</div>
<div>bon hiver hi</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>to order:</div>
<div>more patches, plain t's</div>
<div>cargo pants, jeans</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Thinking: what good would I make for kids if I had kids? Can't settle for my normal plain add quinoa shit</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/5</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>waiting for adam and writing </div>
<div>because doing, in a doing mode</div>
<div>but can’t do: work (too much, too late), reading (no graphs before bed please, and no new books), stretching (like, done), music (too transportive before sleep)</div>
<div>so doing. doing this.</div>
<div>today at work sort of fucking up. this silverton ED measure. running by year. but then switching to a while loop and aggregating the month by month. but like. not entirely blaming myself. not familiar enough with measure.</div>
<div>keyboard squeaking.</div>
<div>body stiff.</div>
<div>new mick jenkins and message of preaching love and how to do that.</div>
<div>i get it.</div>
<div>but like need to get the lyrics more. a conversation. </div>
<div>today at work a bit restless. this silverton ED stuff giving me something to do. but before that. staring at </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lately can’t poop without my phone</div>
<div>lately just one cup of coffee a day, reverting, and stomach feeling better</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>an ant on the keyboard. the new room. communicated through snapchat, family whatsapp group. spacebars on the door, like a little portal. not really, though if painted black, would be like this. and now blue japanese floor seating.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>for like 2 hours after work, touching up on elderly health diagram. okay looks better i suppose. though really just more minimal. like where did work time get put in to? i suppose centering and moving things slightly. with grid, and illustrator, probably much quicker.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>me as a technologist.</div>
<div>car rides with abhi. in the morning, providing a bagel (flip back to bagel shop, tall spunky blonde girl serving. rainbow plain bagels). look i’m so nice. beautiful and sunny out. (thinking, if i didn’t write about this moment right now - beautiful morning would have evaporated given the singular confined zone day presented otherwise). shower, oats, stretching at leisure. then: a shot of coffee, nico jar. outside, staring at the sun.</div>
<div>(watching a video of lil yachty’s dad talk about him - how did i stumble into this?)</div>
<div>wanting to: bail on vermont. because work mostly. like i need to get a start on design and prototyping and things and not be a robot.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>oh datathon ideas in the morning one sort of like routes to death if that’s even possible?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A scary content life in a suburb listening to steady beat rap all the time</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/9</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>‘observations from afar’ as some sort of name for a blog or something</div>
<div>observations from afar:</div>
<div>tinder girl, 70% positive, her on diesel. on date, also 70% positive. </div>
<div>some sort of somerville crazies like lady who seemed to accelerate into me then apologized well giving gratified, hyper-friendly (coked up?) type smile.</div>
<div>last night no socialization, just like chilling in house and watching solange videos for a little. then - sleep, followed by difficulty sleeping.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a duetan. most likely colorblind.</div>
<div>a personality portrait = new project.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>recognizing demeanors as evidence of making sense of the world by projecting own experiences (onto others, other things..)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>rotating shoes, people staring at rotating shoes</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/11 getting high after working late, going on walk, and listening to danny brown best decision combination as of late</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>beats on the walk</div>
<div>over and over</div>
<div>semi catchy but 2 repetitive </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>looking at the basketball court contours</div>
<div>somerville at its finest</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>would really like a girl in some capacity atm</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>danny brown dude crazy</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>deep deep breaths outside while walking. wow. so beautiful. but also, satisfied with just a short jaunt. what does this mean? 2 digital?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>things i’ve meant to write about as of late:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>many.</div>
<div>man.</div>
<div>work wire framing all day somewhat stressful and results maybe awful? maybe not?</div>
<div>2 laptops near my lap.</div>
<div>whut.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i suppose i like my job</div>
<div>i tell myself while interviewing myself throughout day</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>really digging my room</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last weekend one night mostly working mostly unsuccessful so sprinkling of chilling. prev night with angela and non german friends living in germany. grad school for just a couple thousand? perhaps consider. plan b.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>am i on the product team? i don’t know. luke saying ‘not sure if we;ll be able to return him.</div>

<div>9/12</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>monday morning. short hair (fresh cut), breakfast with the house pending.</div>
<div>that’s it. breakfast time so never finished.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now continuing, 9/13.</div>
<div>the body. a bit stiff. knees somewhat brittle. single speed bike? sitting all day at work, not even a little walk. and and - back to circuit workouts. feeling more fit, getting more lean - but also, for first time, questioning sustainability of workouts. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today. fresh from work. relatively early (6:30), nick out, mike + luke leaving. so, at home, sifting through closet, unloading into new mini dresser. mini. isiah rashad bumping. taking stream of music with me: walking in somerville. past sundry white people. a beautiful and calm day. in control, sort of. walking by Spoke like this is a nice date spot actually not really a bit too intimate like what would i do on a date maybe i should get back on tinder and try to find a date? thought dropped. feeling my body, strange to walk. it’s comfortable here. how quickly i’ve moved on from brooklyn. on the bike, the same thoughts, but somehow more true - or rather, verified - in motion.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>crackling sounds, from nico jaar. revisiting in light of ~nico jaar show in providence. adam in shower. stalling to synchronize dinner. and getting ~in touch with myself. because where have i been, days fading?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>days fading but it’s not so bad. i mean going by. not interminable. feeling relatively unproductive. but restlessness dissipating, some focus taking place.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night. eid mubarak calls - the intention. result: a single, 1.5 hour call to meral. and a missed call from adam. with meral, talking in depth about psych rotations. now supervising people. and shaayaan’s wedding, an amazing time. and me: back to somerville. new place. weird times with yaseen &amp; co. and other weird stories because i’m weird (&lt;- meral).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back in the house. working a bit on this twilio BS. </div>
<div>what do i need to spark me and energize me. i think i’m sharp, focused. etc. but need a spark.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then vash home around 10:30. us on the couch, talking about end of other people label. but nico show. and and. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a restless sleep.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lately in product land.  </div>
<div>(interrupted)</div>

<div>finished wiki, progress on risk stuff</div>
<div>with guys all night</div>

<div>fascinating</div>
<div>his day</div>
<div>seafood ramen chilling party meeting japanese dude</div>
<div>and japanese dude manager of submarine</div>
<div>sleeps like 3 hours / day</div>
<div>crazy life</div>
<div>why</div>
<div>then submarine videos</div>
<div>shockingly high text thinking of permutations for error god must be so much greater in 3d space though i suppose more open space less need to be precise but still comparatively crazy</div>
<div>writing and coming back to life feels good</div>
<div>now gaining focus feeling better about life and work overall </div>
<div>weird afternoons of 2 much coffee and weird snack and sitting and weird</div>
<div>today thinking about gym sustainability like hm maybe this is actually getting boring been doing this shit for a while </div>
<div>revamping interfaces for the company</div>
<div>like away from phone less and able to focus on activities for long periods of time and overall relatively stable</div>
<div>but hey i need a girl</div>
<div>and then yesterday - well before, let’s talk about before first - angela. dinner with angela. and like damn she’s cute but taken now.</div>
<div>speculating like if she’s interested or if that would work and what it would be like</div>
<div>guess i don’t know</div>
<div>then day after dinner with vira. area 4. dainty fancy semi-hipster industrial pharmaceutical vibes. her setting in quickly, boyfriend and all. good place, car, job. all that. about her brother, precocious and too cool for his age. life w me. social life. what’s that?</div>
<div>new room like dope</div>
<div>man should i can i be corporate forever</div>
<div>a couple joints tonight</div>
<div>outside talking about?&gt;</div>
<div>before siavash came in dramatically</div>
<div>with adam</div>
<div>comfort of living here, bbq speculation</div>
<div>contacts lately</div>
<div>loving the new rug</div>
<div>tasting dry bread with siavash, him wanting me to eat with some pb to experience what he experienced and me thinking  - what a demanding thing - complete and utter attention and domination of someone’s state of mind. with a conversation, the slightest amount of attention and brain space a privilege. </div>
<div>woo</div>
<div>good 2 write</div>
<div>adulthood</div>
<div>continue</div>
<div>brb later</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>9/19</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mon morning, waking up, thoughts racing. (Falling asleep, thoughts racing - the puffs of j precipitating thought avalanche. Work and Angela and Tanya and girls girls girls). Over and over in head, Isaiah Rashad. Roll up for the shqwa. And then .. Pop a xanny, make yo problems go away. Image of him with son on loop. (A short Isaiah rashad, one of the first things this morning. Tired start, shower, white button down, black slacks, Stan smith (not meshing as well as I expected but good enough / comfy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(Missed bus, so outside, in Arlington, writing. Sign up for kickboxing soon? Mass bjj directly across)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And thinking of: siavash's dominating personality. A quick question about sql table leading to him overtaking computer, trying solution (shouldn't have asked..). When walking into room, demanding complete attention. Would give anyone complete attention I suppose, but vash with enough self importance to demand that. And somehow roped into smoking, when really not feeling that. Tho maybe fact that Adam was too.</div>
<div>And dominating conversations - on phone, too. Like. Me, not dominant.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Sitting in living room, projecting videos for: Vince staples prima Donna, ras g, Isaiah, and then - curb. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The day Sunday mostly errands laundry cooking sort of thing. Phone calls to Tanya (for an hour, hmhm), Noor. Thanksgiving?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Saturday. Breakfast and: directly outside, to Davis. Nine bar, murakami. At nine bar, me awkward, half looking at guy w glasses who I've ordered from many times (shouldn't I at least ask how he's doing), half at coffee strains though ordering cold brew so no choice there. Next time less aekward, okay? Conversations about respective dogs, ahead of me. Their personality traits, tendencies, and recent life events. Still cannot lift the 'white people weird' opinion.</div>
<div>Beautiful outside.</div>
<div>Spanish speaking man asking for directions to 87 bus. Thinking: this is interesting. This man, stranger, asking me things. Murakami' world growing more complex..the book sort of about arbitrariness of attempting to derive meaning from life. Driven mainly by decision to be a certain type of person. Tho maybe murakami differs in this regard, characters seeming to fall into personality / tendency against will. Until 1pm, sitting out. Then: back in the house. To siavash's room, bringing bbq strategy and immediately: vibe, idea, enthusiasm killed. How he doesn't really want to get a car because then it's a thing. (Even tho, me driving an getting car). All these little qualifiers, told with a tone that undermined idea and framed it as burden inflicted on him. Personality dominance here: things imposed into vash, that serve others better, much less important. </div>
<div>Rant rant rant. Reminding self that: Siavash freee to do as he pleases, communicate whatever opinion about this bbq. Tho inconsiderate, I shouldn't be dominated by his opinion. (In a sense, his fault that personality is dominant, but in situation like this, not trying deliberately to dominate. In care ride too: quiet. Which is okay.

<div>Directly after returning from bbq endeavors, Siavash leaving. Discussing the nature of vibe kill, how not entirely mal-intentioned but still not cool. And quietly, getting to bbq work. A little bit of forced enthusiasm. Around 6 (time of bbq). Everything in place. Speakers blasting. Sitting on couch, a relaxed sigh. Casey, then Angela. 'Do we like X?'</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>tinder. not terribly unsuccessful lately.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking back to the summer. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work, mainly.</div>
<div>in response to ‘what’s on head’</div>
<div>stimulated and focused the whole day and not even sleeping well so perplexing</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>should sleep</div>
<div>the sort of manic i want to do everything high feeling tho</div>
<div>but yet.</div>
<div>must work out</div>

<div>#theotherhalf</div>
<div>a good tagline for..something?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today, a car to work. </div>
<div>yesterday. trip back. delirious but slightly coffee wired. in traffic. tim hecker playing, sunset. fantasies of: getting high (maybe), going on long bike ride, listening to music, and writing. (still quite feasible).</div>
<div>(did not follow through. ate / made lunch, did a lil work, then: presidential debate)</div>
<div>work more </div>
<div>but be alive</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>listening to beautiful anonymous. a slightly awkward call. and really didn’t go past surface. but still managed 1 hour conversation out of someone who isn’t that willing to give too much about themselves. </div>
<div>thinking: sometimes conversations just awkward (even with best conversationalist). and with this, a train of thoughts - socializing. when it’s meaningful to me. do i enjoy only when it’s ‘getting me somewhere’. like only talk about self if doing so will show this train of thought in new light.but then: the motivation to just share. share yourself, your thought. if i see this as privilege from others, should think the same about myself. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>self categorization, of course</div>

<div>body going crazy</div>
<div>new room vibes</div>
<div>at work today:</div>
<div>revising same risk things blah blah documentation annoying erd shitty oracle software.</div>
<div>on the bus today, and bike, both ways. at home, riding in the super dark. cold. already. nico jar new album sounding beautiful.</div>
<div>and before: booma collective. blown away by beats vash has shown me.</div>
<div>needing to prepare resume for josh right right</div>
<div>at work  i need to need to get this done but really i don't</div>
<div>so horny lately</div>
<div>nico jaar wow.</div>
<div>for moments long moments today just giving myself up to the music</div>
<div>amazing an amazing feeling</div>
<div>with adam talking about our days. him: lunch at home again. dope dope like skipping school default dope. </div>
<div>i suppose i feel more secure with myself lately </div>
<div>invite a party with all of everyone we know, cool or not (with a light drawn somewhere) is the plan.</div>
<div>looking at these words sideways like it’s a graph. why no word wrap on this shit.</div>
<div>just slightly restless judging on gum i chew throughout day, coffee i drink.</div>
<div>how many states of mind have i been traveling through lately? </div>
<div>not spilling the words</div>
<div>the thoughts tho</div>
<div>these extremely visceral sounds from what siavash is playing</div>
<div>prefacing the songs</div>
<div>so incredibly passionately</div>
<div>body not good stiff</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/2</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mushy brain yesterday</div>
<div>Now, taking in new nico jaar. Intricate underneath but a layer of sort of..accessible dancey music. Thought often removing that top layer. Still, a not so close listen and it sounds like normal music. Not nico music. 'No' on repeat last night, while walking to casey's.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At casey's many people. Kamblamzah. Country music really the worst, everyone except for Frankie the southerner agreeing. Frankie. A name that makes me stop and ponder, explore the possibilities of the label.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Hey maybe I should feel more confident about myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>About once every few days: maybe I should call Stef now. Ah no now's not right. Would prefer beats on this walk etc etc.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Drinking whiskey. Not really tasting good but me I'm drinking drinking. Nika, a white and not Persian girl living in Chicago. She cute. She makin friends. She here for career fair, working for JP Morgan..</div>
<div>Table discussion of Kanye</div>
<div>Like I ordered an uberxl and Solomon kept accepting like fuck him. Girl maybe it's not Solomon's fault damn.</div>
<div>This crew of girls. Doing makeup and things</div>

<div>Broken cartridge: song by ras g. In shattered voice: remember me, over and over. Beautiful.</div>

<div>Reef walking in after</div>
<div>3 hour musings</div>
<div>The summer things: engagement, Brooklyn move, Vancouver wedding.</div>
<div>These things. </div>
<div>Religiousness in three phases, or more: religious, atheist, rejecting label of atheist, rejecting idea that religion and success can not coexist. Instigating the last idea: play called disgraced. Pakistani, originally Muslim man who (synonym for reject)s his heritage, thinking it detracts from his success. From vision of self.

<div>9/12</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>monday morning. short hair (fresh cut), breakfast with the house pending.</div>
<div>that’s it. breakfast time so never finished.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now continuing, 9/13.</div>
<div>the body. a bit stiff. knees somewhat brittle. single speed bike? sitting all day at work, not even a little walk. and and - back to circuit workouts. feeling more fit, getting more lean - but also, for first time, questioning sustainability of workouts. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today. fresh from work. relatively early (6:30), nick out, mike + luke leaving. so, at home, sifting through closet, unloading into new mini dresser. mini. isiah rashad bumping. taking stream of music with me: walking in somerville. past sundry white people. a beautiful and calm day. in control, sort of. walking by Spoke like this is a nice date spot actually not really a bit too intimate like what would i do on a date maybe i should get back on tinder and try to find a date? thought dropped. feeling my body, strange to walk. it’s comfortable here. how quickly i’ve moved on from brooklyn. on the bike, the same thoughts, but somehow more true - or rather, verified - in motion.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>crackling sounds, from nico jaar. revisiting in light of ~nico jaar show in providence. adam in shower. stalling to synchronize dinner. and getting ~in touch with myself. because where have i been, days fading?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>days fading but it’s not so bad. i mean going by. not interminable. feeling relatively unproductive. but restlessness dissipating, some focus taking place.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night. eid mubarak calls - the intention. result: a single, 1.5 hour call to meral. and a missed call from adam. with meral, talking in depth about psych rotations. now supervising people. and shaayaan’s wedding, an amazing time. and me: back to somerville. new place. weird times with yaseen &amp; co. and other weird stories because i’m weird (&lt;- meral).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back in the house. working a bit on this twilio BS. </div>
<div>what do i need to spark me and energize me. i think i’m sharp, focused. etc. but need a spark.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then vash home around 10:30. us on the couch, talking about end of other people label. but nico show. and and. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a restless sleep.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lately in product land.  </div>
<div>(interrupted)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>9/17</div>
<div>1:15 post night chilling in davis hood</div>
<div>sucked into tinder</div>
<div>one reply and one robot that at first seemed real?</div>
<div>re-examining website</div>
<div>thoughts of</div>
<div>feeling inspired inspiration okay now maybe i kinda wanna build things</div>
<div>today sort of a productive day at work</div>
<div>finished wiki, progress on risk stuff</div>
<div>with guys all night</div>
<div>a cult of people who take new members and look at their stomachs</div>
<div>siavash laughing</div>
<div>siavash’s riveting, detailed gory story of surgery and all its drama</div>
<div>awake for most</div>
<div>image of it without processing, attached emotion or sentiment</div>
<div>fascinating</div>
<div>his day</div>
<div>seafood ramen chilling party meeting japanese dude</div>

<div>sleeps like 3 hours / day</div>
<div>crazy life</div>
<div>why</div>
<div>then submarine videos</div>
<div>shockingly high text thinking of permutations for error god must be so much greater in 3d space though i suppose more open space less need to be precise but still comparatively crazy</div>
<div>writing and coming back to life feels good</div>
<div>now gaining focus feeling better about life and work overall </div>
<div>weird afternoons of 2 much coffee and weird snack and sitting and weird</div>
<div>today thinking about gym sustainability like hm maybe this is actually getting boring been doing this shit for a while </div>
<div>revamping interfaces for the company</div>
<div>like away from phone less and able to focus on activities for long periods of time and overall relatively stable</div>
<div>but hey i need a girl</div>
<div>and then yesterday - well before, let’s talk about before first - angela. dinner with angela. and like damn she’s cute but taken now.</div>
<div>speculating like if she’s interested or if that would work and what it would be like</div>
<div>guess i don’t know</div>
<div>then day after dinner with vira. area 4. dainty fancy semi-hipster industrial pharmaceutical vibes. her setting in quickly, boyfriend and all. good place, car, job. all that. about her brother, precocious and too cool for his age. life w me. social life. what’s that?</div>
<div>new room like dope</div>
<div>man should i can i be corporate forever</div>
<div>a couple joints tonight</div>
<div>outside talking about?&gt;</div>
<div>before siavash came in dramatically</div>
<div>with adam</div>
<div>comfort of living here, bbq speculation</div>
<div>contacts lately</div>
<div>loving the new rug</div>
<div>tasting dry bread with siavash, him wanting me to eat with some pb to experience what he experienced and me thinking  - what a demanding thing - complete and utter attention and domination of someone’s state of mind. with a conversation, the slightest amount of attention and brain space a privilege. </div>
<div>woo</div>
<div>good 2 write</div>
<div>adulthood</div>
<div>continue</div>
<div>brb later</div>

<div>9/19</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mon morning, waking up, thoughts racing. (Falling asleep, thoughts racing - the puffs of j precipitating thought avalanche. Work and Angela and Tanya and girls girls girls). Over and over in head, Isaiah Rashad. Roll up for the shqwa. And then .. Pop a xanny, make yo problems go away. Image of him with son on loop. (A short Isaiah rashad, one of the first things this morning. Tired start, shower, white button down, black slacks, Stan smith (not meshing as well as I expected but good enough / comfy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(Missed bus, so outside, in Arlington, writing. Sign up for kickboxing soon? Mass bjj directly across)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And thinking of: siavash's dominating personality. A quick question about sql table leading to him overtaking computer, trying solution (shouldn't have asked..). When walking into room, demanding complete attention. Would give anyone complete attention I suppose, but vash with enough self importance to demand that. And somehow roped into smoking, when really not feeling that. Tho maybe fact that Adam was too.</div>
<div>And dominating conversations - on phone, too. Like. Me, not dominant.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Sitting in living room, projecting videos for: Vince staples prima Donna, ras g, Isaiah, and then - curb. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The day Sunday mostly errands laundry cooking sort of thing. Phone calls to Tanya (for an hour, hmhm), Noor. Thanksgiving?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Saturday. Breakfast and: directly outside, to Davis. Nine bar, murakami. At nine bar, me awkward, half looking at guy w glasses who I've ordered from many times (shouldn't I at least ask how he's doing), half at coffee strains though ordering cold brew so no choice there. Next time less aekward, okay? Conversations about respective dogs, ahead of me. Their personality traits, tendencies, and recent life events. Still cannot lift the 'white people weird' opinion.</div>
<div>Beautiful outside.</div>
<div>Spanish speaking man asking for directions to 87 bus. Thinking: this is interesting. This man, stranger, asking me things. Murakami' world growing more complex..the book sort of about arbitrariness of attempting to derive meaning from life. Driven mainly by decision to be a certain type of person. Tho maybe murakami differs in this regard, characters seeming to fall into personality / tendency against will. Until 1pm, sitting out. Then: back in the house. To siavash's room, bringing bbq strategy and immediately: vibe, idea, enthusiasm killed. How he doesn't really want to get a car because then it's a thing. (Even tho, me driving an getting car). All these little qualifiers, told with a tone that undermined idea and framed it as burden inflicted on him. Personality dominance here: things imposed into vash, that serve others better, much less important. </div>
<div>Rant rant rant. Reminding self that: Siavash freee to do as he pleases, communicate whatever opinion about this bbq. Tho inconsiderate, I shouldn't be dominated by his opinion. (In a sense, his fault that personality is dominant, but in situation like this, not trying deliberately to dominate. In care ride too: quiet. Which is okay. But somewhat insulting, because the silence dominates and swallows our enthusiasm). </div>
<div>At u haul, filling propane tank and getting bbq advice from foresight-filled man filling his backup tank even though no bbq directly in sight.</div>
<div>(Now, bus stop. Woman, Indian perhaps, dressed in all purple. A wool type dress. Damn..)</div>
<div>Directly after returning from bbq endeavors, Siavash leaving. Discussing the nature of vibe kill, how not entirely mal-intentioned but still not cool. And quietly, getting to bbq work. A little bit of forced enthusiasm. Around 6 (time of bbq). Everything in place. Speakers blasting. Sitting on couch, a relaxed sigh. Casey, then Angela. 'Do we like X?'</div>

<div>today, a car to work. </div>
<div>yesterday. trip back. delirious but slightly coffee wired. in traffic. tim hecker playing, sunset. fantasies of: getting high (maybe), going on long bike ride, listening to music, and writing. (still quite feasible).</div>
<div>(did not follow through. ate / made lunch, did a lil work, then: presidential debate)</div>
<div>work more </div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>listening to beautiful anonymous. a slightly awkward call. and really didn’t go past surface. but still managed 1 hour conversation out of someone who isn’t that willing to give too much about themselves. </div>
<div>thinking: sometimes conversations just awkward (even with best conversationalist). and with this, a train of thoughts - socializing. when it’s meaningful to me. do i enjoy only when it’s ‘getting me somewhere’. like only talk about self if doing so will show this train of thought in new light.but then: the motivation to just share. share yourself, your thought. if i see this as privilege from others, should think the same about myself. </div>

<div>work today on a screen really all day</div>
<div>body going crazy</div>
<div>new room vibes</div>
<div>at work today:</div>
<div>revising same risk things blah blah documentation annoying erd shitty oracle software.</div>
<div>on the bus today, and bike, both ways. at home, riding in the super dark. cold. already. nico jar new album sounding beautiful.</div>
<div>and before: booma collective. blown away by beats vash has shown me.</div>
<div>needing to prepare resume for josh right right</div>
<div>at work  i need to need to get this done but really i don't</div>
<div>so horny lately</div>
<div>nico jaar wow.</div>
<div>for moments long moments today just giving myself up to the music</div>
<div>amazing an amazing feeling</div>
<div>with adam talking about our days. him: lunch at home again. dope dope like skipping school default dope. </div>
<div>i suppose i feel more secure with myself lately </div>
<div>invite a party with all of everyone we know, cool or not (with a light drawn somewhere) is the plan.</div>
<div>looking at these words sideways like it’s a graph. why no word wrap on this shit.</div>
<div>just slightly restless judging on gum i chew throughout day, coffee i drink.</div>
<div>how many states of mind have i been traveling through lately? </div>
<div>not spilling the words</div>
<div>the thoughts tho</div>
<div>these extremely visceral sounds from what siavash is playing</div>
<div>prefacing the songs</div>
<div>so incredibly passionately</div>
<div>body not good stiff</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/2</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mushy brain yesterday</div>
<div>Now, taking in new nico jaar. Intricate underneath but a layer of sort of..accessible dancey music. Thought often removing that top layer. Still, a not so close listen and it sounds like normal music. Not nico music. 'No' on repeat last night, while walking to casey's.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At casey's many people. Kamblamzah. Country music really the worst, everyone except for Frankie the southerner agreeing. Frankie. A name that makes me stop and ponder, explore the possibilities of the label.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Hey maybe I should feel more confident about myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>About once every few days: maybe I should call Stef now. Ah no now's not right. Would prefer beats on this walk etc etc.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Drinking whiskey. Not really tasting good but me I'm drinking drinking. Nika, a white and not Persian girl living in Chicago. She cute. She makin friends. She here for career fair, working for JP Morgan..</div>
<div>Table discussion of Kanye</div>
<div>Like I ordered an uberxl and Solomon kept accepting like fuck him. Girl maybe it's not Solomon's fault damn.</div>
<div>This crew of girls. Doing makeup and things</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Broken cartridge: song by ras g. In shattered voice: remember me, over and over. Beautiful.</div>
<div>
<div>now, 1369 shop. waiting for reef, early here to write. a girl with: baggy light jeans, adidas, glasses. ay. (actually talking to girl next to me like: you got the last table hehe)</div>
<div>yesterday. unable to focus b/c horny. and sort of like saving horniness for saturday night? as if it’s this force i can harness.. so like half working. running lazy queries. knowing exactly what numbers to pull but like really not feeling it (break down percentile by .1</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div>lately evaluating myself, and not just like writing externally enough (&lt;-pt and case).</div>
<div>Reef walking in after</div>
<div>3 hour musings</div>
<div>The summer things: engagement, Brooklyn move, Vancouver wedding.</div>
<div>These things. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/3</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today like looking at cargo pants</div>
<div>i mean that’s what i’m doing now</div>
<div>a good sort of giddy energy leaving work</div>
<div>design session, brainstorming w nick</div>
<div>him mainly driving, but an important distinction - my innovation - is that we should look at connectedness of procedures when considering a referral. like even if provider is going through a shitty referral, is there a better option? a ride in the bmw, old school. a cold air rushing through. light conversation, rap on shitty speakers. flatbush zombies at first. </div>
<div>super awake how me gonna gym</div>
<div>it’s okay let’s rely on manic energy because depressed energy last saturday, right?</div>
<div>no - more like, 2 cups of coffee today. whoops. why?</div>
<div>prescription meeting going well mainly.</div>
<div>bon hiver hi</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>to order:</div>

<div>9/12</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>monday morning. short hair (fresh cut), breakfast with the house pending.</div>
<div>that’s it. breakfast time so never finished.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now continuing, 9/13.</div>
<div>the body. a bit stiff. knees somewhat brittle. single speed bike? sitting all day at work, not even a little walk. and and - back to circuit workouts. feeling more fit, getting more lean - but also, for first time, questioning sustainability of workouts. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today. fresh from work. relatively early (6:30), nick out, mike + luke leaving. so, at home, sifting through closet, unloading into new mini dresser. mini. isiah rashad bumping. taking stream of music with me: walking in somerville. past sundry white people. a beautiful and calm day. in control, sort of. walking by Spoke like this is a nice date spot actually not really a bit too intimate like what would i do on a date maybe i should get back on tinder and try to find a date? thought dropped. feeling my body, strange to walk. it’s comfortable here. how quickly i’ve moved on from brooklyn. on the bike, the same thoughts, but somehow more true - or rather, verified - in motion.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>crackling sounds, from nico jaar. revisiting in light of ~nico jaar show in providence. adam in shower. stalling to synchronize dinner. and getting ~in touch with myself. because where have i been, days fading?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>days fading but it’s not so bad. i mean going by. not interminable. feeling relatively unproductive. but restlessness dissipating, some focus taking place.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night. eid mubarak calls - the intention. result: a single, 1.5 hour call to meral. and a missed call from adam. with meral, talking in depth about psych rotations. now supervising people. and shaayaan’s wedding, an amazing time. and me: back to somerville. new place. weird times with yaseen &amp; co. and other weird stories because i’m weird (&lt;- meral).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back in the house. working a bit on this twilio BS. </div>
<div>what do i need to spark me and energize me. i think i’m sharp, focused. etc. but need a spark.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then vash home around 10:30. us on the couch, talking about end of other people label. but nico show. and and. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a restless sleep.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lately in product land.  </div>
<div>(interrupted)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>9/17</div>
<div>1:15 post night chilling in davis hood</div>
<div>sucked into tinder</div>
<div>one reply and one robot that at first seemed real?</div>
<div>re-examining website</div>
<div>thoughts of</div>
<div>feeling inspired inspiration okay now maybe i kinda wanna build things</div>
<div>today sort of a productive day at work</div>
<div>finished wiki, progress on risk stuff</div>
<div>with guys all night</div>
<div>a cult of people who take new members and look at their stomachs</div>
<div>siavash laughing</div>
<div>siavash’s riveting, detailed gory story of surgery and all its drama</div>
<div>awake for most</div>
<div>image of it without processing, attached emotion or sentiment</div>
<div>fascinating</div>
<div>his day</div>
<div>seafood ramen chilling party meeting japanese dude</div>
<div>and japanese dude manager of submarine</div>
<div>sleeps like 3 hours / day</div>
<div>crazy life</div>
<div>why</div>
<div>then submarine videos</div>
<div>shockingly high text thinking of permutations for error god must be so much greater in 3d space though i suppose more open space less need to be precise but still comparatively crazy</div>
<div>writing and coming back to life feels good</div>
<div>now gaining focus feeling better about life and work overall </div>
<div>weird afternoons of 2 much coffee and weird snack and sitting and weird</div>
<div>today thinking about gym sustainability like hm maybe this is actually getting boring been doing this shit for a while </div>
<div>revamping interfaces for the company</div>
<div>like away from phone less and able to focus on activities for long periods of time and overall relatively stable</div>
<div>but hey i need a girl</div>
<div>and then yesterday - well before, let’s talk about before first - angela. dinner with angela. and like damn she’s cute but taken now.</div>
<div>speculating like if she’s interested or if that would work and what it would be like</div>
<div>guess i don’t know</div>
<div>then day after dinner with vira. area 4. dainty fancy semi-hipster industrial pharmaceutical vibes. her setting in quickly, boyfriend and all. good place, car, job. all that. about her brother, precocious and too cool for his age. life w me. social life. what’s that?</div>
<div>new room like dope</div>
<div>man should i can i be corporate forever</div>
<div>a couple joints tonight</div>
<div>outside talking about?&gt;</div>
<div>before siavash came in dramatically</div>
<div>with adam</div>
<div>comfort of living here, bbq speculation</div>
<div>contacts lately</div>
<div>loving the new rug</div>
<div>tasting dry bread with siavash, him wanting me to eat with some pb to experience what he experienced and me thinking  - what a demanding thing - complete and utter attention and domination of someone’s state of mind. with a conversation, the slightest amount of attention and brain space a privilege. </div>
<div>woo</div>
<div>good 2 write</div>
<div>adulthood</div>
<div>continue</div>
<div>brb later</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>9/19</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mon morning, waking up, thoughts racing. (Falling asleep, thoughts racing - the puffs of j precipitating thought avalanche. Work and Angela and Tanya and girls girls girls). Over and over in head, Isaiah Rashad. Roll up for the shqwa. And then .. Pop a xanny, make yo problems go away. Image of him with son on loop. (A short Isaiah rashad, one of the first things this morning. Tired start, shower, white button down, black slacks, Stan smith (not meshing as well as I expected but good enough / comfy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(Missed bus, so outside, in Arlington, writing. Sign up for kickboxing soon? Mass bjj directly across)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And thinking of: siavash's dominating personality. A quick question about sql table leading to him overtaking computer, trying solution (shouldn't have asked..). When walking into room, demanding complete attention. Would give anyone complete attention I suppose, but vash with enough self importance to demand that. And somehow roped into smoking, when really not feeling that. Tho maybe fact that Adam was too.</div>
<div>And dominating conversations - on phone, too. Like. Me, not dominant.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Sitting in living room, projecting videos for: Vince staples prima Donna, ras g, Isaiah, and then - curb. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The day Sunday mostly errands laundry cooking sort of thing. Phone calls to Tanya (for an hour, hmhm), Noor. Thanksgiving?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Saturday. Breakfast and: directly outside, to Davis. Nine bar, murakami. At nine bar, me awkward, half looking at guy w glasses who I've ordered from many times (shouldn't I at least ask how he's doing), half at coffee strains though ordering cold brew so no choice there. Next time less aekward, okay? Conversations about respective dogs, ahead of me. Their personality traits, tendencies, and recent life events. Still cannot lift the 'white people weird' opinion.</div>
<div>Beautiful outside.</div>
<div>Spanish speaking man asking for directions to 87 bus. Thinking: this is interesting. This man, stranger, asking me things. Murakami' world growing more complex..the book sort of about arbitrariness of attempting to derive meaning from life. Driven mainly by decision to be a certain type of person. Tho maybe murakami differs in this regard, characters seeming to fall into personality / tendency against will. Until 1pm, sitting out. Then: back in the house. To siavash's room, bringing bbq strategy and immediately: vibe, idea, enthusiasm killed. How he doesn't really want to get a car because then it's a thing. (Even tho, me driving an getting car). All these little qualifiers, told with a tone that undermined idea and framed it as burden inflicted on him. Personality dominance here: things imposed into vash, that serve others better, much less important. </div>
<div>Rant rant rant. Reminding self that: Siavash freee to do as he pleases, communicate whatever opinion about this bbq. Tho inconsiderate, I shouldn't be dominated by his opinion. (In a sense, his fault that personality is dominant, but in situation like this, not trying deliberately to dominate. In care ride too: quiet. Which is okay. But somewhat insulting, because the silence dominates and swallows our enthusiasm). </div>
<div>At u haul, filling propane tank and getting bbq advice from foresight-filled man filling his backup tank even though no bbq directly in sight.</div>
<div>(Now, bus stop. Woman, Indian perhaps, dressed in all purple. A wool type dress. Damn..)</div>
<div>Directly after returning from bbq endeavors, Siavash leaving. Discussing the nature of vibe kill, how not entirely mal-intentioned but still not cool. And quietly, getting to bbq work. A little bit of forced enthusiasm. Around 6 (time of bbq). Everything in place. Speakers blasting. Sitting on couch, a relaxed sigh. Casey, then Angela. 'Do we like X?'</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Cowboy bepop</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Journal. Thoughts spilling but not eloquently. Get back on it..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>9/20</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This morning a half hour snooze I don't remember</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Last night: Adam resonating over personality episode of invisibilia. Resonating. Personality as fluid. Directing conversation to indecisiveness, career.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Morning. Death grips the main motivation behind 3 mile run. Leisurely coffee, ny times after. </div>
<div><br/></div>

<div>thinking: sometimes conversations just awkward (even with best conversationalist). and with this, a train of thoughts - socializing. when it’s meaningful to me. do i enjoy only when it’s ‘getting me somewhere’. like only talk about self if doing so will show this train of thought in new light.but then: the motivation to just share. share yourself, your thought. if i see this as privilege from others, should think the same about myself. </div>

<div>revising same risk things blah blah documentation annoying erd shitty oracle software.</div>
<div>on the bus today, and bike, both ways. at home, riding in the super dark. cold. already. nico jar new album sounding beautiful.</div>
<div>and before: booma collective. blown away by beats vash has shown me.</div>
<div>needing to prepare resume for josh right right</div>
<div>at work  i need to need to get this done but really i don't</div>
<div>so horny lately</div>
<div>nico jaar wow.</div>
<div>for moments long moments today just giving myself up to the music</div>
<div>amazing an amazing feeling</div>
<div>with adam talking about our days. him: lunch at home again. dope dope like skipping school default dope. </div>
<div>i suppose i feel more secure with myself lately </div>
<div>invite a party with all of everyone we know, cool or not (with a light drawn somewhere) is the plan.</div>
<div>looking at these words sideways like it’s a graph. why no word wrap on this shit.</div>
<div>just slightly restless judging on gum i chew throughout day, coffee i drink.</div>
<div>how many states of mind have i been traveling through lately? </div>
<div>not spilling the words</div>
<div>the thoughts tho</div>
<div>these extremely visceral sounds from what siavash is playing</div>
<div>prefacing the songs</div>
<div>so incredibly passionately</div>
<div>body not good stiff</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/2</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mushy brain yesterday</div>
<div>Now, taking in new nico jaar. Intricate underneath but a layer of sort of..accessible dancey music. Thought often removing that top layer. Still, a not so close listen and it sounds like normal music. Not nico music. 'No' on repeat last night, while walking to casey's.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At casey's many people. Kamblamzah. Country music really the worst, everyone except for Frankie the southerner agreeing. Frankie. A name that makes me stop and ponder, explore the possibilities of the label.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Hey maybe I should feel more confident about myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>About once every few days: maybe I should call Stef now. Ah no now's not right. Would prefer beats on this walk etc etc.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Drinking whiskey. Not really tasting good but me I'm drinking drinking. Nika, a white and not Persian girl living in Chicago. She cute. She makin friends. She here for career fair, working for JP Morgan..</div>
<div>Table discussion of Kanye</div>
<div>Like I ordered an uberxl and Solomon kept accepting like fuck him. Girl maybe it's not Solomon's fault damn.</div>
<div>This crew of girls. Doing makeup and things</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Broken cartridge: song by ras g. In shattered voice: remember me, over and over. Beautiful.</div>
<div>
<div>now, 1369 shop. waiting for reef, early here to write. a girl with: baggy light jeans, adidas, glasses. ay. (actually talking to girl next to me like: you got the last table hehe)</div>
<div>yesterday. unable to focus b/c horny. and sort of like saving horniness for saturday night? as if it’s this force i can harness.. so like half working. running lazy queries. knowing exactly what numbers to pull but like really not feeling it (break down percentile by .1</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div>lately evaluating myself, and not just like writing externally enough (&lt;-pt and case).</div>
<div>Reef walking in after</div>
<div>3 hour musings</div>
<div>The summer things: engagement, Brooklyn move, Vancouver wedding.</div>
<div>These things. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/3</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today like looking at cargo pants</div>
<div>i mean that’s what i’m doing now</div>
<div>a good sort of giddy energy leaving work</div>
<div>design session, brainstorming w nick</div>
<div>him mainly driving, but an important distinction - my innovation - is that we should look at connectedness of procedures when considering a referral. like even if provider is going through a shitty referral, is there a better option? a ride in the bmw, old school. a cold air rushing through. light conversation, rap on shitty speakers. flatbush zombies at first. </div>
<div>super awake how me gonna gym</div>
<div>it’s okay let’s rely on manic energy because depressed energy last saturday, right?</div>
<div>no - more like, 2 cups of coffee today. whoops. why?</div>
<div>prescription meeting going well mainly.</div>
<div>bon hiver hi</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>to order:</div>
<div>more patches, plain t's</div>
<div>cargo pants, jeans</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Thinking: what good would I make for kids if I had kids? Can't settle for my normal plain add quinoa shit</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/5</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>waiting for adam and writing </div>
<div>because doing, in a doing mode</div>
<div>but can’t do: work (too much, too late), reading (no graphs before bed please, and no new books), stretching (like, done), music (too transportive before sleep)</div>
<div>so doing. doing this.</div>
<div>today at work sort of fucking up. this silverton ED measure. running by year. but then switching to a while loop and aggregating the month by month. but like. not entirely blaming myself. not familiar enough with measure.</div>
<div>keyboard squeaking.</div>
<div>body stiff.</div>
<div>new mick jenkins and message of preaching love and how to do that.</div>
<div>i get it.</div>
<div>but like need to get the lyrics more. a conversation. </div>
<div>today at work a bit restless. this silverton ED stuff giving me something to do. but before that. staring at </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lately can’t poop without my phone</div>
<div>lately just one cup of coffee a day, reverting, and stomach feeling better</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>an ant on the keyboard. the new room. communicated through snapchat, family whatsapp group. spacebars on the door, like a little portal. not really, though if painted black, would be like this. and now blue japanese floor seating.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>for like 2 hours after work, touching up on elderly health diagram. okay looks better i suppose. though really just more minimal. like where did work time get put in to? i suppose centering and moving things slightly. with grid, and illustrator, probably much quicker.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>me as a technologist.</div>
<div>car rides with abhi. in the morning, providing a bagel (flip back to bagel shop, tall spunky blonde girl serving. rainbow plain bagels). look i’m so nice. beautiful and sunny out. (thinking, if i didn’t write about this moment right now - beautiful morning would have evaporated given the singular confined zone day presented otherwise). shower, oats, stretching at leisure. then: a shot of coffee, nico jar. outside, staring at the sun.</div>
<div>(watching a video of lil yachty’s dad talk about him - how did i stumble into this?)</div>
<div>wanting to: bail on vermont. because work mostly. like i need to get a start on design and prototyping and things and not be a robot.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>oh datathon ideas in the morning one sort of like routes to death if that’s even possible?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A scary content life in a suburb listening to steady beat rap all the time</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/9</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>‘observations from afar’ as some sort of name for a blog or something</div>
<div>observations from afar:</div>
<div>tinder girl, 70% positive, her on diesel. on date, also 70% positive. </div>
<div>some sort of somerville crazies like lady who seemed to accelerate into me then apologized well giving gratified, hyper-friendly (coked up?) type smile.</div>
<div>last night no socialization, just like chilling in house and watching solange videos for a little. then - sleep, followed by difficulty sleeping.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a duetan. most likely colorblind.</div>
<div>a personality portrait = new project.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>recognizing demeanors as evidence of making sense of the world by projecting own experiences (onto others, other things..)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>rotating shoes, people staring at rotating shoes</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/11 getting high after working late, going on walk, and listening to danny brown best decision combination as of late</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>beats on the walk</div>
<div>over and over</div>
<div>semi catchy but 2 repetitive </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>looking at the basketball court contours</div>
<div>somerville at its finest</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>would really like a girl in some capacity atm</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>danny brown dude crazy</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>deep deep breaths outside while walking. wow. so beautiful. but also, satisfied with just a short jaunt. what does this mean? 2 digital?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>things i’ve meant to write about as of late:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>many.</div>
<div>man.</div>
<div>work wire framing all day somewhat stressful and results maybe awful? maybe not?</div>
<div>2 laptops near my lap.</div>
<div>whut.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i suppose i like my job</div>
<div>i tell myself while interviewing myself throughout day</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>really digging my room</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last weekend one night mostly working mostly unsuccessful so sprinkling of chilling. prev night with angela and non german friends living in germany. grad school for just a couple thousand? perhaps consider. plan b.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>am i on the product team? i don’t know. luke saying ‘not sure if we;ll be able to return him.</div>

<!DOCTYPE en-note SYSTEM "http://xml.evernote.com/pub/enml2.dtd">
<en-note>Last night euphoric manic smoking. The state of extreme satisfaction/engagement with..all interests (music, design/work) almost paralyzing. In light of Siavash's dream - the choice between choosing acceptance and ceasing to live vs fighting to stay alive - maybe acceptance can translate to easily engaging or getting into something. Devoting your mental space to what you're doing feeling. So not entirely counter to the fight to stay alive? Or am I reframing semantically here and missing the point
<div><br/></div>
<div>Siavash's dream:</div>
<div>Alone, in a desert. On the verge of death. Heart literally on the floor. Thinking, logically: no opportunity to stay alive. So accepting death. But just as he dozes, a flash of memories, life surging. And suddenly: fighting, painfully, to stay alive. To no avail.</div>
<div>Beautiful synthesis of philosophical, practical problems with meditative mindset: acceptance vs complacency. Heart on the floor as indicator of too much objectivity, losing emotions. And of course the question of - should he have fought? Not clear. Though situation was hopeless, one would hope that instinct is to still fight. Or not - because that's stupid and painful. Or maybe he was driven to this point because he was so accepting. His heart, emotions, after all, were cause of death.</div>
<div>Brilliant.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Work..at night questioning wireframes and coming to conclusion that concepts are semi coherent but could never work. Too confusing / too much training needed. (Delighted to find, this morning, that nick is into some of the concepts). Fantasies of being lead product designer. (Also a comment by Luke addressing tiny elephant in room - am I staying on team? 'We can't give him back')</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Scattered</div>
<div>Bound to work checking email and things even at night</div>
<div>Skepticism of entrepreneurs </div>
<div>Podcasts over dinner. 99 pct invisible, low income housing following natural disaster.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Morning gym finally not so in shape / questioning hey maybe just sleep bc headache but, retrospectively thinking: good decision.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Rereading emails I sent how I sound?</div>
<div>What's been floating in brain..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>10/15</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>listening to outkast</div>
<div>post shower, post long wait, gratifying but not good falafel.</div>
<div>with adam, previously, a ride to spy pond.</div>
<div>a joke about car driving off platform.</div>
<div>joke real, today, it turns out.</div>
<div>an amazing and beautiful sunset</div>
<div>and colorblindness what is that, thinking?</div>
<div>a slight restlessness lately. like reveling and engaging in things but still still a little bit what’s next feeling</div>
<div>listening to most of new danny brown with adam. electric fire. eclectic fire. spellcheck doing well this time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>morning. passing on armenian picnic to sort of work a lil and sort of worked but also napped and like wasn’t super efficient. but maybe got things done.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>getting high am i doing it too much</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night mfa. the late night thing. lining for over an hour. with tenzin, talking about: boston, capitalism. how to avoid. her sudden clear and concrete values. (room dope)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>saturday. not appropriate for work, i decide.</div>
<div>the bike ride reinvigorating and wow nature, nature is so great - should make trip to national parks. have not been outside very much. i suppose.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the mfa event. boston’s finest. art too static for the mood.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>siavash’s sister - alaleh around. precocious. telling me i look like i’ve been working a lot. or maybe she heard from siavash. </div>

	<div>hi me</div>

	
	<div>a little while.</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>10/22 .. today</div>

	
	<div>a full 8 hours allotted for sleep</div>

	
	<div>though waking earlier. (turns out: avg sleep amount is roughly 8 hours? was under impression that everyone is miserable and sleep deprived?)</div>

	
	<div>suppose not.</div>

	
	<div>emily reo now, casey’s rec. a waxahatchee-american-weekend type. atmosphere for writing.</div>

	
	<div>audio-filled day. morning: clumsily making micro piece of PB, and humming acid rap. so: starting day with chano. bright outside, but dreary, rainy. walking through the basketball court, enjoying chano and enjoying that i’m enjoying. somehow a continuity in what i like legitimatizes me. acid rapcarrying me through whole workout, until danny brown taking over. (about 20 minutes of no music at the end. tuning into conversation of unofficial (i think?) trainer supplementing the ‘go harder’, ‘do it’ with a philosophy of how this is a job/task and you just need, just need to get it done. thinking: unsolicited philosophy sort of annoying, but maybe better than just a hey pls lift harder.running, rowing. at ease, sort of. legs okay. i guess, working out less frequently = easier on joints. </div>

	
	<div>what’s with all this self assessment?</div>

	
	<div>chill out.</div>

	
	<div>lingering: </div>

	
	<div>tim hecker, talk about music production process. audio i meant to revisit and finish. instead: a hidden brain segment on immigration. shankar vaidan. shankar vaidan. his name, repeating over and over. basically: immigration is like totally a historical pattern in this country. trying to also lump current arab=terr threat with past security concerts. reductive. not like that. japanese person = unloyal spy, unlike arab who is indoctrinated, born different, evil somehow.</div>

	
	<div>me i’m arab. rest of segment just okay. podcast okay really. like okay history repeats. but why do people feel sense of entitlement?</div>

	
	<div>listening now to emily reo. rock music, this is good for you. not your usual space.</div>

	
	<div>(and now, visiting grouper).</div>

	
	<div>post-gym, venturing to trader joe’s, stock on niche groceries. on train, a butterfly buzzing around. girl (20-something) making faces, giggling a little, as it hums around her. asian girl next to her is unfazed, standing still. me, jittery hoppy.</div>

	
	<div>walking then, to trader joe’s. passing alewife bathroom. the whole station a bit putrid with rain and sloggy slog. thinking: what would europeans think of this station? or maybe lots of shitty european towns like this? crossing street to get to bridge. teenage girl, biking through the rain. two middle-aged woman, running gear on. walking past me super quickly. (giggly kinda cute butterfly-afraid girl from train spotted at trader joe’s). looking to right, hyper-industrialized vantage point. and thinking dark thoughts of family dying. going in details like: having to explain to work that i’m leaving. moving to dallas. things. why do i have these thoughts? just eradicate. completely. stop feeling sorry for self. </div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>wow i’m feeling really lucid. formula = prob no drugs / relatively sharp mind. hint of sadness, feeling alive. and loneliness, lots of loneliness. or maybe it just comes i don’t know. </div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>comparing, in head, the data problem of many many variables to people trying to assess which field or portion of a product is more meaningful. (design, engineering, blahblah). and how most people in respective fields prioritize their own. to me: there are just too many variables. too many. choose the one in which you see truth. poorly explained, elaborate later.</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>(no coffee for the weekend)</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>extreme bouts of horniness in past week. related largely to: better confidence. work-driven mainly. partly tinder too? though: earlier, a sort of hopeless, but somewhat therapeutic acceptance of me. how i look, and where i fit in terms of attractiveness. after foraging through ~all my photos~ Facebook, phone, profile, whatever. and unable to really find anything far better than average. and shattering that sliver of thought that maybe i am quite handsome that i sustained only because i avoided truly truly confronting others’ perception of how i look. </div>

	
	<div>but like, i guess it doesn’t matter that much anymore now. focus on self, being creative. on style. and the face/body okay. so: reality, acceptance, not so bad. new: nerdier, less abstract looking tinder profile seems to be doing just as well (if not a lil better, people actually talking).</div>

	
	<div>okay.</div>

	
	<div>the thoughts of meeting with people who are not my usual type, not incredibly textbook attractive. finally mustering courage and reasonable, healthy enough attitude to confront?</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>weird when creating self-mandated mission somewhat arbitrarily, and becoming disappointed with self for not fulfilling this expectation that exists only because i just made it? like, today: i’m going to go to the bookstore. and then: ending up napping laundry tea, writing, listening to music. and almost 5. and later: dinner with casey. productive day emerged instead, but somehow, the expectation still lingering.</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>a slight beef today, with vashty. on me really. snapping, for no valid reason, then: digging up for reason to justify myself. vash asking if water from clogged toiler may have overflowed onto floor. i say yes, probably. (not really a probably, definitely did. but, after unclogging toilet, was definitely not about to take on this additional responsibility). vash looking for cleaning supplies, asking me where? i say: under sink. then, finding lysol disinfectant spray. which is: an air freshener. saying: ‘why are you fixated on the term ‘disinfectant’?’. just use bleach. pointing to bleach under sink. vash: ‘why are you angry?’. embarrassment ensuing, searching for justification. the best post-anger justification: clearly, if asking me about basic bathroom cleaning supplies..has never cleaned a bathroom. though realizing, we’ve been in this house just 1.5 months (and before, vash in his own bathroom). i haven’t even deep cleaned. so like. fair. hey that sort of makes sense. but not the real reason. really just upset.</div>

	
	<div>prime example of being adult. taking knowledge that is not inherently logical - but that is pervasive - and faulting others for not knowing this.</div>

	
	<div>okay. need to apologize. </div>

	
	<div>but also frustrated that i need to apologize. because whatever i was grumpy for a sec. which i’m sure vash has been. and also: even though vashty not wrong, wishing that he at least entertained the idea that he was wrong. and maybe realized that hey i’ve never cleaned bathroom maybe that’s why omar snapped.</div>

	
	<div>but that’s not why i snapped. (justification, it turns out, became much more concrete). apologize..</div>

	
	<div>right now: adam in michigan. each of existing in separate zones in this house.</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>a beautiful thing: when separate streams of though on paper. existing independently. but structure has been created, so scattered thoughts are coherent all of a sudden. now: jumping from story of vash -&gt; to confidence / tinder bit -&gt; to me.</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>waking in the morning to mama’s video of person drawing back-facing figure on face. butt on nose. rihanna ‘work’ playing and butt dancing. i suppose, sort of funny. mama following up with ‘did you like video i sent you?’. but not answering the essential questions.</div>

	
	<div>yesterday hanging at alex sheen’s / neha’s, describing where i’m from and suddenly acutely missing yousuf summer, feeling absent.</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>repeating things to people. </div>

	
	<div>(adding this to new: ‘greatest fears’ list). also creating a ‘decisions’ list. irrational thought process type thing. realizing these can all be displayed on a webpage. a simple node data vis type thing. okay. direction here..or at least start, before, potentially, a more complicated data vis project.</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>the question of weed &amp; escapism. thinking lately: maybe effective only temporarily? b/c escaped feelings not carrying through to next day? or maybe, just not writing, reflecting, capturing.</div>

	
	<div>yesterday. back from work. restless. too much coffee? a strong, superficial image of smoking or drinking or even just smoking tobacco. that’s what i need right now. but also not what i need right now. because this is an image. in head, carrying image of brooding emo dude and the smoking drinking while in room, alone, in boxers, listening to music complementary. but then: imagining the ingestion. of tobacco. whiskey. the act so simple, fleeting. cannot be what i need. so pushing onward without substances. (asked vash if interested in smoking - answer = no - opportunity, i suppose to take a little break). could be good. removing the restlessness-satisfiers. quick crunchy food. gum. weed. wash the brain ..</div>

	
	<div>last night. back from work. following the substance dilemma - or, sort of, while actively debating - turning off lights, blasting (super blasting) frank ocean. and really living, engaging in it. some moments yelling out and singing. others semi-dancing. or stretching. or rapping incoherently over beats. amazing rush. showering and coming out: new. improved.</div>

	
	<div>out for walk. raining, raining hard. making to traffic light in basketball court (an expectation: need to see basketball court in rain). but then, turning around. i mean, almost 10. want to come back early. walking to neha’s and getting soaked soaked soaked. minor flooding. walking on street because areas near sidewalk steep a couple of inches. </div>

	
	<div>entering neha’s. conveying, not sure why, urge for adventure this weekend? and then walking up, being hosted. same people as last even, mainly. the blonde ukranian girl greeting me warmly. her quiet boyfriend nearby. sort of like do i shake your hand? and her, name i can’t remember, pointing this out. so: shaking hand, as instructed, and ensuing with small talk. distracted quickly by glass of wine, and guessing game of: what’s good wine? did well. but like choices were pretty obvious it turns out. lais, cute cuban girl i mistook as arab, talking to me. a small circle with me, her roommate/friend shubh, neha. chatting, laughing. okay not feeling like writing about this. but a nice and enjoyable night. refuge from board games with skeptical lais. stories of their bringing stripper for their friend’s bday. and then trip to strip club. all seem to be medical-related things. and florida. things..fun chatting.</div>

	
	<div>them, leaving at midnight, me shortly after.</div>

	
	<div>(short snippet: chris, the sort of awkward guy who said ‘hi omar’, and left me wondering who said that, grew on farm in pennslyvania. entire family growing up near him).</div>

	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	<div>the image of a washed up worker: me, having not worked out for week, carryings pimples on face. though body surprisingly okay despite the workout bit. grappling, as usual, with: comfort w/ body as opposed to complacency. (images flashing, of a less fit me..something the brain never let happen..). fitness, getting ripped, as a mission, prevailing. but need to accept: fluctuation of body throughout day. and feel cool maneuvering in this thing that i live in. like shaking. moving. not just standing at certain angles. angles where stomach pops out. angles where flab is stretched. something i want, wholly, to be unaware of. oddly: detachment from body would produce this? because if truly examining body, feeling no anxiety, then detached? or, i suppose, become actively satisfied with this image. i don’t know.</div>

	
	<div>regardless. homework = sleeping naked. working out, and feeling better.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>10/25</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Somehow missing the bus. I mean not checking the time at all. But expectation was that it would be there, calmly waiting.</div>
	<div>No spoon at Dunkin' Donuts, says grump, sort of helpless looking worker. So instead, opening mouth wide to capture oats and fruit from mason jar.</div>
	<div>4 miles this morning, not 3.</div>
	<div>Oats = consumed </div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>10/</div>
	<div>The impetus for writing = bench near 350 Burlington stop</div>
	<div>A desire to write &amp;&amp; maybe be present </div>
	<div>Talking to myself while rationing coffee</div>
	<div>The cold dark morning / how to set the mood</div>
	<div>Softboy article</div>
	<div>New graph </div>
	<div>Am I popping estamigo to cater to looseness if pants? A valid hypothesis </div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Wanting to write and just observe but somehow if jolt of audio not zapped into ear - and I reach work - I haven't taken advantage of time? That's not it.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Bus.snippets. Cute (Indian?) girl. Phone background: partner kissing her. Why did that stick?</div>
	<div>Reconsidering being considerate (letting others sit, go ahead of me, etc)</div>
	<div><br/></div><div>Yesterday / bus: unfairly appalled by woman squeezing next to me, reeking of (putrid, not normal?) cigs.</div>

<en-note>
<div>today. telling self: you can sleep in, because sleep deprivation yesterday.</div>
<div>the current state.</div>
<div>lower back, a bit sweaty. little bit of snot on my joggers b/c sniffly when biking.</div>
<div>body alive. mind, calm, not racing. existing. thoughts, now, judging the grungy boston rock type hipster. and 1369 aesthetic, this like shitty times new roman.  run-down in a gentle and secretly not run down way. and storefront rocking times new roman. the sign outside: caricature of snoop, snoop dogg? soup dawg. not cool. song now that, i’m sure, appeals because it is ‘earnest'. dude pronouncing works way too clearly, talking in sort of taunting way. and then: that band, the one riley likes. with the girl and slightly above average beats. name? can’t remember. (but like now waxahatchee okay i can actually dig).</div>
<div>am i. am i becoming a judgmental adult? the beauty of developing taste. well - that not inherently beautiful. but more so: the ability to navigate a narrow field well. like now. fashion: focused on cartoon-like streetwear. can rock it, quickly realize what’s good and not. and focus on digital work. but stay wary of these adult feels.</div>
<div>okay whatever you know this stuff no need to write about it.</div>
<div>now, drinking coffee with cardamon. bet ya’ll bitches think you’re innovative. arabs doing it for ages, and better.</div>
<div>okay. i’m here. guitar strum. the ambient chatter, a relatively steady waveform. how to describe the ambient chatter. (this girl walking by now in inman: swear you went to brown). gentle. imagining, the aggregate, overall conversation is a gentle back and forth. conversations of family maybe.</div>
<div>lately weed free. lately = 2 weeks. and now, used to it. barrier to smoking (mentally) greater, and less craving to do it - all the time. but still. dissatisfied, oddly, with the continuous stream state of mind has been. need a disruption. something to signal. this was a new day.</div>
<div>thinking of: conversation with zoe last night (shaved bald). working on a farm and landscaping (jade? also - jade? when are we going to hang out..). and writing a sci-fi novel. this person. in front of me. who i’ve lumped into the broader group of wholesome whites. who i’m using, largely to get my dose of socialization. i mean real socializing, but nonetheless, a dose. ready to go home, to not give too much of myself, take too much of them. etc. this person. is writing a book. also - at the end of the day: produces bits of poetry. the thoughts, the many complex - and incredibly different (from me) thoughts that lead her there. something i can try to access? </div>
<div>(claire cute tho. short &amp; playful conversations with her)</div>
<div>with lev. a friendly, surface level conversation. that, by all measures went well given its limitations. but in head. a background - ‘how will i leave this conversation’. scanning surroundings, what’s next? what happens when this ends. get ride of this thinking.</div>
<div>her process. sometimes: going to public spaces. hearing fragments. taking own fragments. processing. fragments being connected. hm. okay. but process of connecting - forming, somehow, a sci-fi story. whack, opaque. this: a great frontier to enter for brain. so. if rich, ready to quit, and don’t have creative project lined, write a story. and then throw it away.</div>
<div>(public space. energy changing, shifting, picking up. it’s war - trying to put her in a car seat. i mean, i’m a free spirit. a snort, while laughing. next to me. dots, connections, on a paper, juxtaposed with two panes of code, and a coffee. request for, a medium hot chocolate. sour cream muffin. ruffles of a bag, coffee beans pouring. machinery. a loud white noise, to describe lazily. i had never been, so. i got there, pointing, laughing. this woman, walking quickly, looking at me? and i think, smiling? i mean, i’m the only object in this area. but why me? doesn’t make sense. it’s not like harvard. i have my costume. we were like, there already, wishing they would come sooner. phoenix landing. a hug: with woman looking away, away, towards street. and then, a friendly, though terse conversation, with no eye contact. confusing. things that don’t fit in my classification of interactions.).</div>
<div>on my back, pins from sundry ads. costume party. dia de los metros. a boston book festival pamphlet. tasteful red font, with a small monospace denoting the date. a local story. i can read, try to dig. </div>
<div>this week. two runs: 4 mi, 3 mi. joints feeling okay. hey.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>aging. thoughts of that, lately.</div>
<div>earlier this week: sitting in (watching) conversation with kendrick and rick rubin. over sizzling, somewhat tasteful vegetables. at first, general, corny. getting a picture of kendrick’s clear-headed mind. inspiration drawn from: daily life. children, mainly. ay kendrick you like me. how, he holds onto an emotion or feeling, allows himself to feel it. and: with the right beat, the mood, can recall, relive this memory. and convey it. that, a beautiful and incredibly difficult talent.</div>
<div>three cute sophisticated girls walking in. getting less sophisticated, 30 seconds later, as one with clear glasses asking for photo of her to be taken. in a very ordinary spot in coffee shop. giving her friend focus, focused smile, however.</div>
<div>siavash: little fomo. no need to do something because others are. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>what’s your chief innovation today? at work, nick’s proclaiming that mine is: adding negative notifications (i.e. this person did not come in for their appointment). suggesting also: read receipts, for reports. (adding user data back into product). hey i really like this healthcare data stuff.</div>
<div>luke leaving. oho. gershman maybe to take some of his responsibilities. </div>
<div>okay more work things. up until 3:30 thursday night. doing bidco reports. at some point. awake, but no drive to finish. music reviving motivation. feeling that work is sort of repeating existing reports tho. just ever so slightly different. like: is this a good use of my creative (yes - i am creative, convinced now) brain? but hey getting shit done - that’s going directly to world-renowned hospital. kind of cool.</div>
<div>and care management. nick essentially getting back to where i initially presented ideas. adding goals and focus problems from notes section. conveyed this stuff. but was not defensive, assertive enough.</div>
<div>sort of seeing myself at work. timid. not always with it. others seeing maybe as maybe this elusive creative type? or maybe they do think i can communicate well and produce? not sure here.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>wednesday night. dinner with vira, after her event seeing artist-engineer-sculptural guy. obsessed with: mechanisms. vibrant &amp; lovely. jet-black, sunglasses-clad waiter greeting us in thelonius. waiting ~long time~ before sitting, absorbing jazz, and collectively, and individually, being indecisive. joining us: maggie (lira’s friend who i met once in ratty, and observed me from afar, notifying vira i was in the area, in dc), and matthew. not sure what we talked about. one thing: maggie’s app for fulbright. and grad school. in contrast to current life, role as analyst in bank. the energy, great. thinking: damn, so good to be out and socialize. manic type of energy, for a second, while having this thought. dissipating into a more level happiness, throughout. in vira’s place &amp; room, observing her chicken dress. talking halloween. how we’ll all dress as mediocre harrys.</div>
<div>thinking: while writing this. a great night. but how, i only feel this now while writing. so like basically sobriety and focus not always yielding a mental state where ephemeral positivity is channeled into other days.</div>
<div>(vira showing others my website. how nice of her!)</div>
<div>talk about work can be interesting if it’s revolving around mental states, and interactions with others? or maybe just if abstracted. i don’t know.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>finishing coffee - because i finish coffees now.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>moral questions of the week:</div>
<div>amrit, on car ride: do you mainly talk to (stranger) girls who are in your range of attraction? like, would you talk to super unattractive, or super hot girl? supposing not, in spite of self perception.</div>
<div>with siavash: asking girl where she is ethnically from. named kenya. black? from california. identifies with el salvador. tension, though not bothering siavash. (this same mood of thinking of not bearing any fomo. not giving fuck what others thing if it’s not constructive to himself. kenya flustered, offended. immediately. not giving siavash the benefit of the doubt. hm. the idea that ethnicity should not matter is nice. and that siavash asked so early: problematic. wanting to draw conversation from this before trying to understand her in a nuanced way. but the reaction to me, not considerate enough. i suppose. maybe: no tolerance to this is okay? but - not effective. further segmenting the conscious and less socially conscious. hm. </div>
<div>(adam, later bringing up that: asking ‘what’s your ethnicity’ is better).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today. a non-day, really. waking at 11, gym, lunch, and then bike to here. 1369. (picking up books i bought last night, forgot to return). running and thinking about running. and this mix by sango. how sango really is not that good. day dominated by permutations of what to do. carry backpack and change to clothing after gym? and lunch outside, trip to central. or: come back and shower. and then walk to davis. or bike? or bike to gym. wait no, can’t bike to gym, because returning packages. all of the configurations shattered, when, after workout, seeing that i forgot to bring boxers in backpack. so: going home. then cooking, biking to central.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>while cooking: siavash describing dreary, air-heavy day as ‘so beautiful’. adam and i settling on spaghetti squash pad thai for potluck, after searching through mental list of quirky dishes.</div>
<div><br/></div>

	<div>but too quiet</div>

	
	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	
	<div>destroying my moment of silence</div>

	
	
	<div><br/></div>

	<div>an acute feeling of wanting her</div>

	
	
	<div>close to me</div>

	
	
	<div>like maybe should visit type thoughts</div>

	
	
	<div><br/></div>

	
	
	<div>feeling out of shape</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	
	
	<div>body in pain</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	
	
	<div>back from vermont</div>

	
	
	<div>writing, in attempt to continue stream of wholesomeness, restfulness, mental satisfaction into week</div>

	
	
	<div>so like let’s reflect</div>

	
	
	<div>past week</div>

	
	
	<div>first four days like work work</div>

	
	
	<div>but interesting because pressure and late nights that’s different right</div>

	
	
	<div>and then thursday</div>

	
	
	<div>drinking with work people. and engaging, really engaging in small talk. seeing this people as more human, growing maybe a bit more attached, fond of workplace.</div>
	
	<div><br/></div>
	
	<div>Continuing, 11/7</div>
	
	<div>A clear head despite 6 hour sleep, smoking before bed. (Smoking not dramatically changing state of mind, or taking me out of post Vermont glow as imagined.)</div>
	
	<div>Bleeg a yog?</div>
	
	<div>Humanmade noises, from our house. Potential in a sound museum.</div>
	
	<div>Man really need to get coding and in personal projects. Time, time, time.</div>
	
	<div>Gym music not quite right in morning. 18 pull-ups, 42 for set of 3. Not bad.</div>
	
	<div>Body sculpting outs it's default self. Skinnier. No worries working out in a week. In bed, yesterday, naked - of own will. Progress. </div>
	
	<div>Siavash's weekend. Party at andrei's. People shrooming. Painting. Spectacle.</div>
	
	<div>Topics of weekend</div>
	
	<div>(Internal, mainly) - get car?</div>
	
	<div>And, related, embracing adulthood. Eric a proponent.</div>
	
	<div>Economic systems that incentivize growth and equity. Casey, the trailer park driven by land lottery. Matt, redistribution.</div>
	
	<div>The hustle.</div>
	
	<div>Jobs respective jobs. Systemic change. Selling out - a fallacy?</div>
	
	<div>Liz. Teaching. Family problems, teenage drug addict in house. Exhausting, hopeless school system. 20 minute lunch. Indoors all day. Kids restless, inattentive. And - languages. Bilingual school but mono lingual parents.</div>
	
	<div>Cosmicomics. Space personification. Abstract concepts, deep philosophical convictions, stemming from objective scientific concepts.</div>
	
	<div>Japan. Neilesh and Caylin.</div>
	
	<div>Diana. Real concern &amp; worry over election.</div>
	
	<div>Family family.</div>
	
	<div>New York / thanksgiving / May booking dinner without me. Pressed leaves waiting.</div>
	
	<div><br/></div>
	
	<div>Writing so normal so mundane.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>11/8</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Yesterday a work day. Meetings 2:30 on. Morning, finishing </div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Salmon, wild rice dinner &amp; 538 podcast about risk. 'Eat slowly' sort of working.</div>
	<div>Chat with Adam. Hopping around and zooming through things, really. Brother buying house for family to move into. Everyone except for papa in Michigan. Working out, a more mature, less lifty perspective. Putting in the hours. people coming in to hospital demanding painkillers. Trip to Cincinnati for Meral. Eating, mainly. Missing us. Planning for Texas. Seems unlikely.</div>
	<div>Hm. </div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Yawns. A crowded bus. My body a free flowing thing, hard to reign in, prevent from hitting into people.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>At work. Taking over Luke's engineering interface responsibilities. Err. A good opportunity? Not really the one I want. But I suppose cementing my status on team. Creative work vs visible, impactful. Which do I want really? Knowing that I want to end up at impactful, but now sort skipping creative grind I had imagined.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>The lady - in her 40s - green poofy jacket with patches lazily pinned on. Off to work in another square brown building.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Journalism keeps society in check, helps prevent corruption. That makes sense.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Quality reports. Making information presentation decisions holding me back.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Reflecting in the morning, on the bus. How do you like that, brain?</div><div><br/></div><div>11/10 (Wait already?)</div><div><br/></div><div>The stream of thoughts related to - success/power vs creativity.

<div>How much of my personality is built on not knowing my personality?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Voiding warrantys </div>
<div>(written from bus)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now, in room. grouper on headphones. lights dimmed. deliberate precipitation of emotions. the feeling of ‘i like that sentence’ as the sentence spills. vain. the aesthetic of the sentence. more than the sentence. but aesthetic is not vain, is it?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at work, past couple of days. brain spread in many places. this stupid silly git commit. working as the engineering interface. ccda requirements. ccda, what?! further split as i listen to meetings going on in room</div>
<div>feeling like i’m not conducting myself well at work. not enough outward enthusiasm. not enough - asking for things, battering people, asking questions, etc. watching as Nick/Michael go about meetings like Triage seamlessly, coming to a decision quickly and gracefully. me, however..</div>
<div>need also, to establish myself as ‘the design person’. not included in user conference meeting (which necessitates a website / some design), datathon discussion. though, datathon discussion - apparently me and abhi getting highest score in datathon?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>perception of body is okay. i feel bigger and more powerful but like less lean. i don’t know. when am i ever happy with this thing? switching to room workouts, maybe a better / more sustainable option for most of week? rather than waking at 6..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on bus today. a plan, as i enter, to be meditative. 1 min in, hey let’s listen to tribe. hmm.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>myself, the self crystallizing. conversation with baba about car. and how, in a few years, of course i’ll need one (marriage, etc), but not now. my life, my life.</div>
<div>is great. wonderful. the thought, as i’m walking to work. relatively sunny. some coffee, tribe in me. and how - even without a car - life is so good. challenging and fulfilling job with great coworkers. nice safe neighborhood. money to buy dope clothes. visit fam. dope things. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hey i think i should produce ambient music.</div>
<div>okay. listening to this like i think i can do this because this is my brain. it aligns with sound waves. thought waves, sound waves.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(whole lot of things from weekend but let’s write about that later).</div>
<div>bout of music listening, writing, at night (as transition from straight work). part of new initiative to respect myself. ensure i feel creatively satisfied, rejuvenated for next day. this could work.</div>
<div>of course - the thought of, doing this. the writing, listening, high. but problem lately is split brain, smoking won’t help unify. weed, just a tool.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>not a writer but i write.</div>
<div>not a musician but i make music.</div>
<div>not an analyst but i analyze.</div>
<div>not a ..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>11/17</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>She the type to wait for the walking signal </div>
<div>Not my type</div>
<div>Walking to bus stop</div>
<div>Future playing</div>
<div>Finna start shit</div>
<div>Ego driven fantasies of girls, loud parties w drugs</div>
<div>No different from future I suppose</div>
<div>Evoking article about music as self medication, mood regulation. Should I listen to music I don't feel like to control mood? But damn feeling future right now.</div>
<div>Evoking article evoking interview with frank ocean. Sticking points: I think I'm one of the best in the world what I do. It's more interesting to me to do something I'm naive in/ have no experience with than hone craft I've mastered. Hm. And now - series of thoughts trying to understand specialization vs broad thinking in life goals. Which is better? Latter = more curiosity, zest, empathy? Or just burnt out, confused?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Ambient music before bed bringing vivid dreams. Morning - driving car. Around Arlington I think. Acura? And then wondering: wait, did I just take someone else's car? And then - awake. Symbolism confusing. Other dream - clearer symbolism, seeing Ingrid (bumble girl) with her boyfriend? Me being jealous b. </div>
<div>(Date for Saturday, Nour. We see..)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Yesterday. Restlessness at work. Eating various chocolate foods, pretzels. Maybe - just go outside.</div>
<div>Forcing self, before bed, to listen to music. (Deciding, not to smoke. Too indulgent, brain feels active, can properly absorb something). Weird shit. Because - cannot surrender to the adult world. The mundane aspect at least. Must incorporate some non work related disruption into brainwaves. How perfectly appropriate - in bed, naked (adult comfort), listening to odd music (young spirit). Trying to imagine tim Heckers process. Fascinating. What's guiding this music. Beatles, formless, cohesive. Emotional state, memories? Or gradually steeping self in atmosphere, positive feedback from music? (With Tanya, messages about music)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>As much as bus is really draining my time, one of the more interesting parts of day. Objectively. Enumerating the stimuli: noise from the bus. A menagerie of people - races, economic status, profession. Scenery, zooming by. Light conversation, activity. Option to enter a zone of music, with this in visual cortex. Deciding, likely likely, against the car.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(Stranger looking over shoulder. Maybe writing makes discouragement more explicit)</div>
<div>(The world is full of beautiful music).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So much more to write..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>11/19</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>listening to social experiment</div>
<div>stretching</div>
<div>odd push up</div>
<div>odd sip of coffee</div>
<div>let’s add writing to the mix</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>2pm today, date with nour in JP. </div>
<div>oh man. stress of date spot. simon’s is cool? but not next to anything cool? so we bike from there?</div>
<div>or park st? but not trying to do a repeat date.</div>
<div>jp? too far?</div>
<div>kendall? er but i don’t know that area.</div>
<div>20 minutes of ruminating in bed - and settling on JP. yay.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>almond butter bread usual, spinach on the side, breakfast. siavash, saying hi, and disappearing (returning shortly with peter).</div>
<div>then - talking with little ones for an hour. many many questions. this time, my endurance short. and also, needing mental space before date. like exam.</div>
<div>yousuf not reading. summer becoming more of a nerd. proud of affiliation with smart/clever harry potter house. doing riddles for fun. less time on iPad.</div>
<div>happy. but doof. the negative discouragement. baba, before handing phone to doof, recalling yousuf’s bad behavior. did you know, yousuf did this?</div>
<div>yesterday, while walking with jackie. describing how mama had me so young. first kid at 19. and then, really, feeling regretful. about my absence. lack of support. lack of understanding. why she’s moody, depressed. things. </div>
<div>wow social experiment super bumpin</div>
<div>last night. eric over. and jackie. a little bit of ‘what next’ type social anxiety but no need. </div>
<div>can i find love in this city? yesterday? mumble rapping to self, adam walking in. maybe pretending he didn’t notice (or just not noticing). a quick recovery to general singing. as opposed to, talking my self seriously, type rapping.</div>
<div>siavash, all out act last night. all of us tho, relatively silly. sipping wine, gradually. sharing roses and thorns. eric, radiant as usual. stories of, stories of. silliness of regretting past few years. adam’s real life scenarios at work. a slight restlessness surging through.</div>
<div>— — </div>
<div>hm let’s read not write</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>11/20</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>self medication</div>
<div>meditation</div>
<div>20 minutes, naked</div>
<div>blinds down</div>
<div>focus on: breath. no: repeat, ‘i accept myself. i love myself’. but this phrase. it’s too tenuous. i need to repeat a symbol that actually stands for the concept of loving myself.</div>
<div>focus on: sound. wind chimes. the screen door, swaying. a car, occasionally. the air conditioner. much easier.</div>
<div>brain wandering to:</div>
<div>yesterday. the date. her. replaying different segments. why didn’t i ask her more about herself? why didn’t i get deep, emotional? game. let’s get back to this.</div>
<div>today, waking up, restless. 6:45, but 8:15 really out of bed. peanut butter and bread. adam walking by. observing the different butters.</div>
<div>a stress. or. something weighty, tangible in my brain. this thing. this date.</div>
<div>cloudy outside.</div>
<div>have not felt this way in a while - since, depression era? sophomore year? i don’t know. but the paralysis of circular thoughts. fixation, dwelling on flaws. just one flaw. dwelling. living.</div>
<div>in the bathroom. brushing teeth. staring at myself. blankly. not checking myself out. just. observing. a sort of ‘this is me’.</div>
<div>the feeling of not wanting to do anything, really. don’t want to gym. or bike to a coffee shop. but forcing both. </div>
<div>circuit working. body shaky, but alive, good, after. mostly blocking out thoughts.</div>
<div>coming out of cvs, protein bar in hand. and running into angela. a nice surprise. things with coworker particularly bad, impulsively buying thanksgiving ticket. me: i have plans. maybe, angela says, she can come over and knit socks? yea. yes. join forces with siavash.</div>
<div>taking off to forge. running first into haily tran. a semi-forced number exchange. well not entirely forced - on the pretense of potentially climbing together. her and friend, leaving to library for work.</div>
<div>alienation, sort of.</div>
<div>but not from tomas. running into tomas riegos, daryl’s friend. incredibly earnest, focused conversation. asking me what i’m doing. like at the moment. care management design. cascading questions. to him - what have you been doing here? a job, that was not what he expected. enumerating how he wants career that 1) he is good at, 2) surrounded by people he respects, would like to grow in convergence, 3) focused on building more inclusive something (communities, housing)? at first, investment in creative entrepreneurs. but now, a scattered collaboration with nonprofit. sort of? trailing off as his friend - long-haired, geo grad from brown joins. a geo major. exchanging numbers - let’s meet sometime.</div>
<div>in weird depressive dwelling state, producing a number of divergent, relatively solid ideas for care management notification stream. unable to bind thoughts though.</div>
<div>is my brain chemistry off?</div>
<div>no. </div>
<div>out of many days this year - or at least in boston. stable, relatively. small mood swings, but overall perception of self. or - self worth. solid. and then - a small event. and shattered. (normal people like this?)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>confused by small comments throughout date. ‘thanks for getting me outside’. ‘i’m your elder’ jokingly. ‘i’ll get you next time’. ‘we should go to isabella gardner’. i think? a we - is what she said. i guess these are all friendly. what’s not friendly? was i too friendly? showed no intimacy, didn’t try to get close to her. even when sitting down in the middle of the woods. do people just say things? false promises. or rather - false rumination. i don’t know. or did she process this after and not have good feeling?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>backing up. after date. feeling okay. talking to cab driver, after dropping nour off. how i meet people? explaining bumble to him. that this was my first date. fascinated. his family, japanese wife. older daughter, who he raised on his own, and now, two super young children. warm interaction, wishing luck with second date. </div>
<div>warmth quickly evaporating as i enter home. dark. what do i do? not really feeling like anything. sort of an impending shitty feeling? but have not even entered a negative thinking space yet. well, doing groceries. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>early yesterday. beautiful &amp; sunny. sort of paralyzed by prospect of date. should i gym? but then not enough time to do weird stretches and read and feel focused and mentally invigorated. and talk to parents. like outside reading but not focusing. on the bench near diesel, homeless man uttering half meaningful, half gibberish words. leaving bench, finding sunny spot, and delivering a muffin to him. cannot have caffeine for fear of seizures. doodling until like 1:50, then transporting to JP. half reading.</div>
<div>(earlier talking to summer and yousuf. for an hour. school lately. books. activities. favorites. potato. i’m a potato. potato. with yousuf, worried about reading.)</div>
<div>train stop. entering digital art gallery. cranes, in different orientations, in loop? and: rotating projectors with ginger dude (vocalist) singing. sometimes harmonizing, sometimes not. face rotating entire time. strange.</div>
<div>at city feed. unsure what to do with self, body. standing outside? okay. walking down the block and back. going inside. sitting near a window. no real room to talk &amp; meet stranger. nour coming in. seeing her from the street. looking..as pictured. cute. a nice, not awkward hug. sort of stumbling until she asks me - do you want to get coffee? a quick, ‘yes’, picking stuff up (jacket, book), and waiting in line. kind of half asking her about work in line. why did we start the conversation with work? getting closer to cashier. a comment about sticky buns, so grabbing one, along with coffee &amp; tea for nour. coffee is fill yourself. not realizing this, but nour grabs my cup. somehow covering what i do, break in nyc, her job. in one quick, fell swoop. google mapping way to arboretum. already getting dark. 3ish. light conversation, walking there. but easy. seeing a dog. ‘you don’t have the arab anti-dog gene?’. no, a bit of a dog whisperer, caretaker. how she converted her dad to like dogs. realizing now, as i recall conversation, that we’re covering big topics quickly. paying attention to each other, but maybe not delving deeply enough. asking me about the book i’m reading. giving an extended description. her sharing her current read. i don’t think i pried further? why not? maybe i didn’t ask enough about her.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>after cab ride, warmth evaporating because: i’m recalling the goodbye. realizing it was a quick hug and ‘good night’. no, let’s hang out again? this. </div>
<div>and then, me. watching show black mirror. first episode. about prime minister having sex with pig in order to save princess. well done. before and after show - debating texting nour. something like: i had fun. let’s hang out. would love to see you soon. no. too personal. i don’t know. sending a neutral ‘had fun hanging out, would love to meet again’. at 10:30. 10:45, already checking phone. why no response. and and and. 10:50. etc etc. phone near me. not charging. sound on. a text from casey at midnight. disappointed. realizing - will not receive text back. and here, pulled from rest. into a sober, wakeful process of dwelling. cannot sleep. the same thought, over and over. </div>
<div>meeting adam and siyi in the kitchen at midnight. looking tired. like. i can’t sleep. siyi, explaining the many methods she uses to fall asleep. but girl..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>was the date even good in retrospect? maybe it was just not enjoyable at all for her. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>writing i suppose not all that therapeutic. yet. just describing state of mind.</div>
<div>at my core. to the flaws.</div>
<div>upset by date because of: prospect of meeting cute smart girl. but also: ego. confidence. she met me. i had 2 hours to talk. ask questions. and - no compelling reason to even meet again. </div>
<div>mainly confidence. incredibly fragile.</div>
<div>already difficulty meeting girls, and this was promising.</div>
<div>that we shared time, space of mind, and that didn’t really mean much to her.</div>
<div>that there’s something about me - or, just me, as a whole - that she didn’t like. !!!</div>
<div>how would i feel if i went on a date with attractive girl who is super into me? somehow, did have sights set on nour. so maybe it’s something about her in particular.</div>
<div>am i actually feeling hopeless? like no girl will like me? i think it’s really just this girl i’m upset about.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>what allowed this to overtake my state of mind? -</div>
<div>at my core. a propensity to swim in negative thoughts. allow them to overtake.</div>
<div>how to fix me? -</div>
<div>better sense of self worth.</div>
<div>not telling fantasies take me far when meeting someone. approach cautiously.</div>
<div>physically, getting brain in a better place.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>11/22</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>more personal catchphrases like</div>
<div>2d, mostly</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>feeling better. hornier, as an indication. siavash leaving tonight, adam and i parting to rooms. putting on swans album, finding myself drawing on graph paper. sloppily. self portraits. art, for me, is so literal.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>fascinated by the idea of learning to draw. to express visually. set constraint of: express one idea i have, or one feeling, visually. monitor over time. could be cool?</div>
<div>the challenge of taking my thoughts, putting them in some sort of black box, and translating them into hand motions. right now, so linear. i’m feeling. like i like okay, but my perception of self is not. a projection of self, dotted image of self. literal. good for the data visual realm. but need to push my brain further.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today. at work. amongst the many engineering meetings, extreme unproductivity (though complements on running feature definition meeting well - though like do i want these complements because i’m not organized i’m rowdy and creative and you can’t tie me down) - a 5 minute update with nick. ‘had a good conversation, with gleeson, about me’. yes, i’m permanent on the team. excited to work with me. a pay raise that is in line with ‘industry standard’ / new title. thinks i’ll be happy with it. 75? i think 75, most likely. 80 would be amazing. title of like junior PM or potentially product analyst? weird title to me - thinking more, associate PM.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a flurry of thoughts related to - putting energy to business. driving and conceptualizing ideas and progress. vs creativity. unbridled creativity. want to have a creative era. or ongoing creative projects. maybe, i push myself to do this outside of work. be a nick. can i aspire for that? </div>
<div>what about, product designer?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i can - work on side projects. do this stint. become a real PM in 2 years. then, at 25, go back to school? </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the temptation of smoking but i guess brain is already in an interesting place.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking back to date with nour at trying to understand at what point she was no longer into it. at the start. super enthusiastic. but then: suggestion to uberpool? i guess. that’s super undatey. and maybe the bit about ‘we should go to museum’ idk maybe i misremembered. or maybe she just said that. ultimately ~it’s a feeling. </div>
<div>deciding also though, that she wasn’t super interesting crazy cool. mad cute tho. definitely, valid disappointment at not seeing her. but weighed heavily by ego.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back to career stuff</div>
<div>*i need to be creative*. *i need to be creative*. a must. how tho?</div>
<div>the data science path, definitely slipping out of my hands. now, thriving as a PM/data vis hybrid.</div>
<div>need to approach with distinct role / title</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>siavash home, then alaleh shortly after me coming. siavash packing in anticipation of bus (in like 20 min). me, packing snacks, uber. amidst chit chat. personal cooking. siavash leaving, adam coming, and then vash returning. unsuccessful, no bus tickets left. the next hour, at the table. giggles. making fun of siavash eating raw tofu. alaleh’s classes. disappointment at the dance class. to adam, before: spilling my career thoughts.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>what would being high feel like? what would it actually feel like? should i? jump into music? or something like this? but maybe - get high and make music.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>swans - an interesting mental space - but what is this album about?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>incredibly distracted last hour at work. </div>
<div>morning. the usual thoughts of music or mindfulness or things things resulting in jeremiah joe, brain feeder artist, album. not moving but not bad. head floating, largely.</div>
<div>recovering from the great tragic date.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>11/29</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>doing the reflection thing.</div>
<div>a sudden feeling of ~self-awareness~ as of late.</div>
<div>aware of me. my desires. weaknesses and strengths.</div>
<div>i’m a creative thinker. i can think quickly. frequently, i’m crippled by indecisiveness. frequently. or sometimes just crippled by choices. choices. like - when i have the option of doing 20 small tasks. don’t do either very efficiently. trying to commit to a time box type thing. i’m predictably unpredictable, a manic self aware unaware confused clear-headed reflective, always-lagging-behind-myself type.</div>
<div>fire truck, cop car posted outside house.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>entering intentional daze, at home. or, curated daze. andy stott, planks, pushups. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>adult illusion of clarity.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>maybe i’m manic because</div>
<div>not much sleep today and actually super awake, way more restful than restful yesterday.</div>
<div>because, after 1.5 hours of unproductive, ostensibly soul sucking, going to bed. mind racing, but in a sort of sharp way. and like, super happy. or rather, feeling better about myself. that’s weird.</div>
<div>needing to finish a small wireframe for assessment screening. not really feeling like working at night. but instead, half asleep, half wondering what to include in - what ended up being a simple wireframe, maybe 1 hour of work.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and my style. is more defined. i know what i’m going for. sort of. but like, don’t fall into the vashty trap. having a vision. and, in the end, ending up too confined. and not able to fully develop vision into something beautiful because inspiration is only internal.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>random lil texts from may. miss you. bon iver. cheeto cravings. things like this.</div>
<div>oh me now opens up about everything to me.</div>
<div>like - it’s no so much the sex sounds. it’s really just the feeling of containment. room, from a space, to a container. self, from an entity. observing doing. to - observing, doing, alone. awareness of the confines that is me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>doing my daily swipes like it’s a chore. and texting ingrid last night to hang - responsive. hey, now demoralized to point of ~not caring~.</div>
<div>i’m cool i’m cool and kinda cute and interesting and cool, right? i believe that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking like - hey should i write and go even more into myself or escape escape and read murakami?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>starting to realize: there all sorts of people in beautiful shapes and sizes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at work the major weakness of not being able to accomplish small tasks because too many small tasks and constant switching very real. a bit better at dealing with it. exacerbated by vague requirements. constantly switching tabs, thinking in loops.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>avoiding decision of tanya vs family on dec 31. so obvious here, tension between desire and who i want to be. wanting to be good person. someone who doesn’t frivolously go off w girl who he likely has no future with. leaving fam that he sees once a year. not that person, that’s not me. but also - not minding all that much if it’s me. so badly want her. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today a podcast about embracing chaos. can get with it. like gosh guys not that revolutionary.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>— oh and this weekend / thanksgiving break — </div>
<div>do i want to go there? fresh in head etc. idk. let’s go there tomorrow. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>---</div>
<div>okay. let’s get to. career path plotting. how can i turn the vague thing that is my ambitions into concrete steps.</div>
<div>values. start with values. creativity. strategic decision making. </div>
<div>okay. level deeper. design work. design work and context. healthcare / company context. problem here is don’t want to spend so much time early in career getting just domain specific knowledge. like how long in arcadia. and also - want to spend time early in career creating dope stuff, building visual / design skills. and portfolio.</div>
<div>why? do i want to design things first? this is the closest i can get to product development. </div>
<div>i want to use care management to develop my client communication skills. develop product dev. develop everything. get really deep on this one, new aspect of the product. more specifically, interface with involution. get feedback from clients. do actual design research? what this mean?</div>
<div>part of the great ux skin 2017.</div>
<div>in this company, i can be a ux expert. healthcare expert. or data science / viz guy. less health. less people. ux/design for sure.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Progress here.</div>
<div>After talking to tanya - creative person moving to more managerial / less creative role. Craving the creativity, finding it difficult to balance. Although I'm missing a lot of healthcare context - and getting this info is super critical to climbing ranks - I am going to prioritize creativity. Use care management, the process of working on, building, managing a product and all its dependencies as a way of getting context. Plus I can be expert in new emerging field that others don't know about.</div>
<div>(This part, also, requires less context).</div>
<div>Giving up - heavy data science work. Client sales calls.</div>
<div>Build build build visual skills. CM is mainly UX. Work on data visualization for all other product components. That is - pop health platform. Care management. Continue to interface with engineering. </div>
<div>Create rigid process for documentation management, and phase this out entirely as my responsibility. </div>
<div>Actually don't mention continual interfacing with engineering.</div>
<div>Product development over healthcare context. Right now at least.</div>
<div>'Data science is janatorial', anyway, as mike pointed out. And like - so I even like science?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>With Siavash, an exercise in assigning each day of the week to a color. My reasoning somewhat sound actually. The burning red passion of Friday, pink, exciting, yet lighthearted hue of Thursday, as starting points.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Hey the white beanie not looking so bad on my head w no glasses. Hey I'm not so bad.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/3</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a prescription of liveliness. coffee. reading - no, actually writing - with ‘u’ by kendrick playing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>jade on her way, 20 min. a sort of giddy excitement i suppose. because self = more developed, confident.</div>
<div>today. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/5</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today real quick i mean real quick because almost and — because don’t want to saturate myself with thoughts of myself. fresh from work, day really just self and work so need something else.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>oh the morning, first thing. doing mini workouts. mountain climbers and jumpy things feel weird so early. need to get heart rate up without moving much. (distracted, just now, looking for solution).</div>
<div>eating overnight oats. okay i suppose. back to bread tomorrow.</div>
<div>an orchestrated morning.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>morning bus ride. catching my eye: two guys, dressed somewhat well, but flashy. one, shiny shoes, blue pea coat. other, black joggers, formal shoes, button down. black dudes. can speak another language. 350 taking while to come, just static on the platform. the guy in black joggers starting some shit, complaining about bus being late on platform.</div>
<div>ending up sitting next to the two. reading data graphics and hearing interspersed bits of bus driver complaint, request to be picked up by girlfriend. the bus packed, diverse. sort of focusing on tufte. really old graphics. not that compelling, but i suppose interesting to have a fundamental grounding.</div>
<div>thoughts of - being instead a data vis guru.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at work. addressing issue of circular work. constant distraction. deciding - only selectively reply to emails. maybe disable outlook email notifications. time box certain tasks. sort of working, determined to get better.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ride back. entering ash koosha.</div>
<div>walking back home. music less. focused.</div>
<div>finishing podcast about nbc chimes. then - this american life about men who were conned (deluded into thinking woman was writing letters) but defended con artists. continue to display images of woman. a representative of friendship. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>more level-headed, calm, clear. a metric - no longer craving or thinking about weed.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div>listening to mac demarco even tho not deep enough to write.</div>
<div>lately at home lots but not insular</div>
<div>like sunday - home all day.</div>
<div>grateful for the large chill dopetastic room. today, also. have yet to step outside. but wonderful. breaking work day in middle with workout, shower, meal. </div>
<div>testing the whole workout in room thing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>okay personal improvement type thoughts.</div>
<div>need to end the circular unproductively at work. this is concrete and i will fix.</div>
<div>the thought pattern is: big task -&gt; indecisive -&gt; little task -&gt; not worth my time, little -&gt; little task -&gt; big task. and again.</div>
<div>(not just a problem at work. also the same sort of thinking that gets me to: never reply to messages, send messages on tinder.)</div>
<div>partly a problem of inertia. but not needing to confront the inertia because other thought routes brain creates.</div>
<div>caused by:</div>
<div>+ (in design work) indecision. really just held up. so think. do something else. come back. rooted in bottleneck in logical decision-making. sort of like what alex tran described. not injecting enough emotion here, so really stuck in decision.</div>
<div>+ pursuing a broader picture. like, hey okay i’m going to work on this one page but wait how is it gonna interface with everything else? so checking every other component.</div>
<div>+ knowing what to do. visualizing the solution. but dread at having to implement. like in sql. sometimes doing little adhoc check, instead of sticking to a few concrete sample cases. or writing a modular way to do something. so 2 issues. 1) dread at having to implement when broad imagination type work is done, 2) wanting easy, instant gratification</div>
<div>+ distraction by:</div>
<div>     checking tasks to do (because always outstanding tasks)</div>
<div>     emails to reply to</div>
<div>     doing so, again. because so many little bits that i can forget i already checked one thing.</div>
<div>     also: not finishing the little tasks.</div>
<div>     slack. teams. notification checking.     </div>
<div>     (what do i have to do? what do i have to do)</div>
<div>     just getting up. eating, etc.</div>
<div>     feeling of: what’s the point in doing this when such little time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>okay how i will solve.</div>
<div>create work streams, and time boxes. like - 30 min of focused work, no email replies, no JIRA, or anything else.</div>
<div>when hitting decision making roadblock: make a (**) here’s what i haven’t considered and move on. placeholders. placeholders. placeholders. like today with CM mockup. how will toolbars be linked to other pages? like. put a fucking icon there. or mark it somewhere. and just. move. on. so many other components to work on.</div>
<div>and: no more dread at doing. after conceptualizing. think - now i’m doing. this is the real thing. it’s beautiful. it’s fucking beautiful.</div>
<div>i’m a get shit done amazing productivity product team type. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hey a comment from olga ‘did i mention i’ve really enjoyed working with you?’. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>--</div>
<div>okay not work</div>
<div>lately brain feels healthy and sort of interesting. </div>
<div>but why?</div>
<div>here’s why some people don’t write.</div>
<div>they get in front of the paper, and think: what do i write?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>but i don’t know catching odd creative thoughts.</div>
<div>and feeling a weird surge of self awareness</div>
<div>of my body. my brain. my value to others.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>--</div>
<div>sickness</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>energy focusing on clothing lately. wanting to build the fundamentals. really refine just a few outfits and looks. and then move broader. right now? do i have that. definitely some favorite outfits. but not complete complete.</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>12/11</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the new me. the - as of yesterday me. does not randomly binge eat. eats slowly. does not get sucked into minor coding endeavors. moves the fuck on. gets the right amount of sad over girls not texting. feels good about self. acknowledges loneliness while reading thinking doing productive activities. has a tight fundamental wardrobe. the basic pants, shirts, etc, down. accents to fill later.</div>
<div>that’s the new me. (things to work on)</div>
<div>friday arriving home. cargo from an uber. headache dominating brain, negative thoughts taking the small crevices left. hype peace sweater - palace-tine. pretty tight. okay nap.</div>
<div>then off to see moonlight. bringing headphones, not listening to music. but like overall. a-what-do-with myself restlessness. like when i come back home? what then? get high? then?..</div>
<div>off to see moonlight. more beautiful each time as i think back. concise. somewhat insular/slow. but appropriately so. easy to pick out symbolism because structure is so contained. leaving movie and sort of thinking hey what’s a concrete thought i can share with morgan? morgan responding with ‘still processing’ when prompted to comment. respect. how to start a conversation like this without actually providing outright criticisms. need to just open an exploratory space for conversation, rather than exchange facts.</div>
<div>throughout the whole weekend - should i text nour a final proposal to hang out? needing a concrete thing to do. museum that’s cool but like also high commitment and exactly what she had suggested. </div>
<div>thursday sending out a ‘hey wanna hang?’ text to ingrid. surprised not to hear back given responsiveness / ostensible interest..but like this is how it is. (saturday 8am, a lengthy text explaining sickness/business). looking through her photos like hey she’s kinda cute. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>siavash coming home thursday night, bagful of brooks brothers in hand. using taste to understand something broader in his brain. his aesthetic sensibility a difficult thing to figure out. overall, and eye for style. large commonality in determining what is dope. but. two navy pants. one corduroy. ‘black pants don’t make sense’. these statements confusing. and then, a slew of the same lee jeans. overall seem to have a somewhat clunky look. style and fashion and building the fundamentals</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>saturday. coding for a few hours. phone call home for 2 hours, discussing new career switch with baba. trip to umra with seto AND kids that’s a little crazy my friend. proposing maybe in that one week when noor and i back. er. taking 2 long. then chatting with summer and yousuf. don’t want to continue shaming into reading.</div>
<div>after, discussing with adam how mama/baba raising summer and yousuf. no positivity in the household. how family mood dominates. a topic we take through cooking.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back from alex sheng’s. cold in room. book in hand, under covers. siavash lying down on floor, back to pillow. i’m bored with work. well, need to meditate, sleep well, then re-evaluate. and stop listening to ash koosha. completely dominating state of mind. interesting. i engage with music, listen to a lot. strongest physical sensation is goosebumps. but intense heart rate fluctuations. limited to music? no. hm. part of me craving a more intense reaction - despite realizing how limiting this is. in line with self-perception of brooding artist.</div>
<div>rapping in hand: they call me artsy, i don’t make art see, just wearing black heart of black, super hard see… something similar maybe a good start.</div>
<div>after, reading a little, dozing at midnight. 10 hours of sleep into next day. indulgent, maybe a little necessary. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the only other world i’m occupying - outside work - murakami. norwegian wood. drawn in story, as usual. but relatively stripped down. little room for the mind to wander, question and project.</div>
<div>health. headaches all week. gone, sort of, now. slight cold to replace.</div>
<div>wow foodman truly one of the most eclectic albums (sonically, sheer frequencies and styles) i’ve heard in a while</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the latest, potentially apt self analysis:</div>
<div>--</div>
<div>lately listening to more formless, experimental music. maybe because feeling grounded, too grounded, in other aspects of life?</div>
<div>--</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/12</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Writing taking too long last night so ditching to work </div>
<div>Work unproductive. Spending too much time in CSS, making small design choices. N</div>
<div>Calm, collected, and stable yesterday. Length meals as indicator. Towards end of day, confined. Maybe because spent so much of weekend working. Sleeping early, no fulfilling interactions. End of night, post murakami. Awake (too much sleep prev night). And wondering: what to do with me? So calling tanya, talking for over an hour. It's easy with her. Resolve to do 'some crazy shit'/destroy stability. Old days of banging in car, being overall deviant..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>On writing, with Siavash. His first day. Smiling, a fulfilling endeavor. Wondering what his journal is like. Oddly worried about security..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Bringing up podcast about emergency medicine ethics. Siavash talking about how for years at brown questions like this dominated his mind. Now, his focus is things he can apply to life. Fiction in this category too. How butler character in book he just read carries similar though patterns // can learn from his flaws. Me: how applying to personal life gets confining. Admire and enjoy aesthetic beauty. Purely. Escape.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Up early today. Like I never slept sort of. Packing things and deciding to ditch weird blue cheese hummus breakfast sandwich I brought. Dark, rainy, slushy. A photo, and caption, as usual in head.</div>
<div>Gym - rowing hard. 4380m in 20min. Best in a little while. 21 on first set of pull ups (how am I getting better?). Danny Brown orchestrating most of workout.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Watching spiky curly hair man on laptop, click clicking but not really working? Cannot still / must work type.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/13</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>clear-headedness continues. work. murakami. alternating worlds.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>—last night. abuzz with banter. from 6:30, dropping things off, conversing with vash. adam walking in. jokes, laughter for hours. siavash telling this story about office manager at wayfarer. cute. exchanged quality small talk. that was story. but said introduction like 100x in, many different ways. me bursting in laughter, almost to point of tears. topics of girls, how we’re all going to get drunk - for first time - together this weekend. things like this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>off to bed last night - no longer feeling this slump, inwardness, loneliness. clean, refreshed, happy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today. relatively focused. sort of productive. forgetting how slow css/web dev can be. still chipping away at single patient summary.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>...</div>
<div>continue in the morning</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/14</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At once super awake and spacey. Can pay attention be sharp, but brain, in equilibrium wants to stare off into space.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>grappling the self</div>
</div>
<div>many thoughts today</div>
<div>yesterday, in contrast to today. calm. craving calm. brain relatively empty. thoughts - focused on how self-aware, clear i am. listening to death grips, somewhat deliberately, to fuck myself up, throw myself off get somewhere else escape escape this thing that is me. but me is not me stripped down. me is not the clear, sharp, empty brain. me is the chaos. that’s me. for now.</div>
<div>
<div>today, the turbulence i crave is back. because - i crave that?</div>
<div>talking to siavash, and then later - adam and siyi - about this. how this state that people supposedly seek. of clarity.</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>uhhh beach house. having not listened or saturated self with music. god this is beautiful. swooning immediately. music can really give yourself away to. let the strings pluck you away.</div>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>usual thread of girls girls girls. hey i’m like healthy and horny just lonely that’s not so bad. </div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div>echoing thoughts:</div>
<div>this morning. well this morning. firstly, leaving late, and taking train. because coffee with nick. chatting with siavash. not sure about what. hm. anyway. munching on usual peanut butter coconut flake - eating fast, but super enjoying. easing into the routine, with shower, ginger tea and stretching. caught up sending a lengthy email. and also: basketball teams. casey like: do you want to put down a down payment and sign up? and like, yes sure? but why would you ask question that way. </div>
<div>but. this morning. as in - meeting with nick. not super satisfying. both us, a propensity for the vague and lofty. my concerns of being overloaded with sundry random things not really alleviated. i mean: the concrete tasks to manage = super useful and in line with what i want. responsible for: some HIMSS posters, all CM mockups, potentially managing contractors who will be implementing CM. and the engineering management BS. all great. and what matters really, because the concrete tasks are what i’m actually doing.</div>
<div>company success: biggest investors = GE (who has many EHRs) and Merck. big playas. 32 million budget raise, as compared to 13 previous time. </div>
<div>in this conversation: in such an intense listening mode that i have few comments and retorts.</div>
<div>but the downsides: still up in the air, this ‘product analyst’. er. that’s unfair. i’m an associate product manager. that’s exactly what i am. and i’ve been working hard. also: not standing up or denying nick’s comment about: gaining more context, picking up anything, any random shit. no. i want to be more focused. more focused right. lies directly in contrast to my goal. then vague mentions of tailoring me into a designer, possibly, in the future. now, no budget, for designer. but i can grow to take that capacity. this doesn’t mean i still can’t be an unofficial design evangelist. (does mean associate product designer is totally not in line, so good i moved away from proposing). i guess i’m being bred into a change maker. well money maker, but i tell myself former..</div>
<div>possible: davis office. (or allston noo). </div>
<div>so really, not end of world - just need to make it clear that: i can’t keep picking up random shit. though i do agree with the concrete tasks, do not agree with the short-term broad vision. yes an associate product manager. yes i need more context. but want to be super super good at care management, and use that as a means of understanding customers. so, rather than attending general sales calls, focusing on care management portions of a sales call. well if i work 12 hour days i suppose i can pull it off. (a comment about burnout on the team - err yes. working this hard + doing such rich variety of work, i think i should get compensated like industry avg? especially considering how tiny team is.)</div>
<div>also - wanted to hear more of the 3 year roadmap.</div>
<div>(separately, need to talk to someone about how to have a salary negotiation conversation. who is the right person? not nick. )</div>
<div>oh right the biggest most salient comment. ‘you have a unique brain. very unique. it’s a great thing. you don’t think like most people. but need to make effort to develop empathy of other people’. i guess i’m an alien.</div>
<div>did get a ‘you’ve been doing great, hearing positive things from everyone’. like who?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i’m not talkative but boy do i write a lot. talkativity != brain activity. social goal: make talkativity = brain activity. (tweeting this, then deleting.) </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in murakami’s world. growing entangled in watanabe’s story. character growth. questioning love, nature of his love. for naoko.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today, totally fucking up product feature meeting. firstly proposing ‘enhanced patient registry’ - but NOT the case. immediately, nick contradicting. and the engineers (tim and tark really) just giving a bad energy. like, understanding this whole stakeholder balance thing. like great for that. but god damn, not wanting anything new exciting. would prefer easiest route. status quo. me don’t get u. leaving meeting, debriefing, and breaking down the many ways i fucked up. ahh. and then in triage meeting, no one even playing the game where pretend i can make calls. just - tagging nick and waiting for later response.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking about the creative process i’ve had lately. how incredibly unproductive it can be. thinking of thing, following a million little threads. tweaking and perfecting something else. sometimes the result isn’t bad? showing CM mockup to Nick - and somehow exceeding his expectation? anyway. like 2 months to finish these mockups.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i think i found an aesthetic i think i make sense or is this a fallacy?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>rejuvenated. a little. today. not in wanting to work really. but more romanticization of work, the world. thinking of re-picking up the brain/thought visualization data viz project. how do i start this? thought archival and intense categorization. manually turn into data? or semi-automated?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>be honest with yourself. a vow. a concrete value.</div>
<div>a potential concrete value: from norwegian wood: don’t feel sorry for yourself. only assholes feel that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>writing is a consistent creative outlet. need to start writing stories and other things. or maybe: continue making weird lists. like push myself in this way. is this art? is this self-expression, in a way that isn’t purely literal? is there a such thing as literal self-expression? everything is obfuscated, a chain of many atoms things translating to emotions, thoughts, words, writing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking lately about: self-expression. primarily in light of nick’s comment pointing to website that has ‘my aesthetic’. didn’t realize people picked up on this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sometimes too many thoughts to reign in and organize, i guess could use organization.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/18</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>poetic on a good day, broody on a bad. numb on an average day.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>‘dude i listened to beach house for like 2 hours and just wrote this week’. casey, relaying, my own comment back to me, in coffee shop. overheard in indie coffee shop.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/19</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>stretching writing in the morning. herb tea to get appetite going (breakfast sitting, on table, waiting for me. imagining situation where someone else eats because like why else leave breakfast there). life hack type shit. ezekiel coning’s beautiful ambient music carrying me through. wow. beautiful &amp; life is great.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>most recently, last night. joking around with adam about needing to get with lucy liu so we have more friends. and, immediately prior, conversation with baba. telling him about my work things. getting a little angry - and in retrospect, definitely should not have - over having extended talk about data modeling and its application to retrieving client requirements. and then - summer and yousuf? good. home alone for most of day, but behaving well.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>looking at this pitchfork weird purple graphic, pastel fonts in weird orientations displayed. in love.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a conversation with reef &amp; ruby. easing in. first - things. academy reminiscing. family, holidays. then: design, specifically. how you can supplement with coding. the user experience component. showing a little of my work. after: typing notes and sending. mentorship is kind of fun.</div>
<div>(the way there - disastrous due to santa run blockade. at intersection, waiting, as endless stream of santas run by. jumping out of car, half running (in boots=hard) to forge.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>after, calm late lunch at kebob kolbeh with yahya, siavash, alaleh (and later casey). meat incredibly flavorful &amp; juicy. easy, calm snippets exchanged. after casey joining, relocating to 1369 coffee shop. no space for rest of crew, so sitting down, and having tea. casey, in a routine, but good. things are good. pausing to talk about the girls. casey texting girl for a few weeks now, but has not met up yet. me: describing date with nour and how nail isn’t fully in the coffin. hey, girls, things. (ego lately a bit more satisfied after reply from nour, ‘i love you’ message from julia, and tinder like from cute girl. how tenuous my ego and happiness are).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yahya’s break-up - needing to be on his own. girlfriend too supportive in some ways. became a weak person. siavash, proud of him. aligns with his own personal philosophy. talking for an extended time about having relationship as crutch for self-confidence. </div>
<div>(and then: many jokes about adam’s yellow fever, tinder, girls..sundry banter)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>clear-headed, fulfilling, long day. beautiful.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a quick chat with mama and noor. excited to go to dallas. think, on plane trip: what do i want from this trip. how can i be most considerate.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hey good friends: casey, siavash, adam, and reef. that’s solid. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today incredibly unproductive. why? entire day to work on CM mockups, and very little accomplished. first 3 hours of day, roughly, small tasks, and then taking apart the overall flow i had built. where do notes go? should i add quick notes, quick tasks in? conclusion: quick notes as separate tab. no quick task, just do from main task. and then thinking about: task stacks. so putting in thought into flow. but needing to build. not able to resolve the dissonance, in first half of day.</div>
<div>second half. too many small things to work on. vague direction. no clear design idea in mind. every task to build is small, and doesn’t feel worth it. but that’s because project now is just sum of many tiny tiny pieces. </div>
<div>tomorrow: need to time box. time box. and concrete tasks. link all pages. create full flow. task now &gt; task later. build out calendar. this is all concrete stuff i can do. by end of dallas trip, need to have full two-pane page done. full full. so after flow, and schedule, need to do goal hierarchy on wednesday. how do we convey focus problems that span multiple goals? let’s think about flow, flow tonight. and then tomorrow: concrete goals, and time boxes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>also - need to get outside. and not be so horny while working. real clothing, working out to get that energy out. i feel sharp, calm, good, collected, and i can get things done tomorrow. i know i can. i know i can. &lt;look at this, real confidence</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/20</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>re-listening to this ezekiel koning piece. siavash had shown me with his speakers, joint and wine in hand. impeccable sound design. disparate sounds from everyday life melding beautifully. how did he think to bring this together, thinking? absorbing.</div>
<div>now - on my speakers. still great. but many channeling the initial experience. realizing that hearing on my speakers first would shape subsequent listens..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>with siavash today. a good - 3 hours? of conversation. over cooking, dessert, chilling. first - small things, jokes. then: work and making enough money to retire early. siavash like - you need more than 200k. tanya, receptionist at his work, and why he is no longer into her. suggesting myers briggs test, speaking lightly and somewhat incorrectly about meditation (despite sort of teaching it). then: relaying story of siavash’s former boss prompting to take myers-briggs. siavash morally offended. viewpoint: no doubt that it can show me something, but gives me no information with which to improve, and make a change. me: morally offended (at least initially, when obaydah proposed) just at the idea of getting label. both of offended at the static aspect of label.</div>
<div>then unpacking - really unpacking (siavash doing great job) - statement of ‘people can’t change’ (echoing may’s mom’s statement about alan). how this is largely true. few people find reason to change. fewer find the right tools. for siavash: why are meditation, therapy (possibly writing) the only tools of finding change. self-awareness as the root of this. hm. i don’t know. maybe.</div>
<div>then: how relationships are miserable. but then: maybe just life is miserable? regardless, we have a head start, knowing and carrying this fact. (how me, as a kid, always resolved not to do what my parents were doing in relationship).</div>
<div>(wow, siavash managed to explain and break so slowly, clearly, gradually. perhaps a bit too slowly, but well done. and me - i managed to listen and absorb like 100%. thoughts of smoking dope tonight eradicating as i realize i should probably carry this focus with me the rest of week).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work. hitting a stride maybe around 1pm. morning, same restless, circular thinking that got me nowhere as yesterday. too many ill-defined requirements coupled with barrier to probing further. and an indecisiveness in pushing through the parts that are defined. wanting elegant, beautiful design immediately. but need to just fucking code and produce. so painful to look at an unfinished UI because it feels like i’ve done nothing. the problems are clear. avoided pattern by finding defined problem to work on (calendar) that just needed to be fucking built. found self in flow for a few hours. tomorrow - how will i do this? need to build forms, link pages, and build out goals.  the first relying on aesthetic decisiveness, last on better requirements. hm. smaller things include: changing patient card data structure. fixing scrolling interaction. time box aesthetic decision making for the morning, when i’m not exhausted. research for afternoon, then building. so until 1pm, time box time box time box.</div>
<div>(lol same as yesterday, rereading)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this lo-fi monospace colorful font aesthetic it’s my aesthetic and vibes with me but why?</div>
<div>because i can do it, pull it off? speaks to fundamental casualness. minimalist, creative, logical type mind, in short. does not take itself too seriously. (or maybe, just lack of real talent).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/23</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>user interfaces user interfaces</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sticky brain notes</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>digital design theory looking at this book at harvard book square. do i like it for my ego or genuine interest? entangled. bit of both.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>tim hacker and daniel lopatin a beautiful combo actually.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i don’t eat slow but i can smoke slow and savor. is that what matters.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>writing can be too much preoccupation with self</div>
<div>looking for memoir at the library</div>
<div>book about hawks this will be hard to get through.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/25</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Smelly Americans getting smelling dogs</div>
<div>Caving birds fucked up</div>
<div>Words exchanged, between nihaya, Asma, Mama. Meanwhile, raeda watching vine length videos </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>All these samples make you fat</div>
<div>Husbands poorly dressed - except for nihaya's</div>
<div>Repeat joke, broadcast </div>
<div>Me style and Obaydeh's</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Why is your hair like that</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The fake people say I love you and compliment</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Every daycare needs camera</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>listening to mac demarco even tho not deep enough to write.</div>
<div>lately at home lots but not insular</div>
<div>like sunday - home all day.</div>
<div>grateful for the large chill dopetastic room. today, also. have yet to step outside. but wonderful. breaking work day in middle with workout, shower, meal. </div>
<div>testing the whole workout in room thing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>okay personal improvement type thoughts.</div>
<div>need to end the circular unproductively at work. this is concrete and i will fix.</div>
<div>the thought pattern is: big task -&gt; indecisive -&gt; little task -&gt; not worth my time, little -&gt; little task -&gt; big task. and again.</div>
<div>(not just a problem at work. also the same sort of thinking that gets me to: never reply to messages, send messages on tinder.)</div>
<div>partly a problem of inertia. but not needing to confront the inertia because other thought routes brain creates.</div>
<div>caused by:</div>
<div>+ (in design work) indecision. really just held up. so think. do something else. come back. rooted in bottleneck in logical decision-making. sort of like what alex tran described. not injecting enough emotion here, so really stuck in decision.</div>
<div>+ pursuing a broader picture. like, hey okay i’m going to work on this one page but wait how is it gonna interface with everything else? so checking every other component.</div>
<div>+ knowing what to do. visualizing the solution. but dread at having to implement. like in sql. sometimes doing little adhoc check, instead of sticking to a few concrete sample cases. or writing a modular way to do something. so 2 issues. 1) dread at having to implement when broad imagination type work is done, 2) wanting easy, instant gratification</div>
<div>+ distraction by:</div>
<div>     checking tasks to do (because always outstanding tasks)</div>
<div>     emails to reply to</div>
<div>     doing so, again. because so many little bits that i can forget i already checked one thing.</div>
<div>     also: not finishing the little tasks.</div>
<div>     slack. teams. notification checking.     </div>
<div>     (what do i have to do? what do i have to do)</div>
<div>     just getting up. eating, etc.</div>
<div>     feeling of: what’s the point in doing this when such little time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>okay how i will solve.</div>
<div>create work streams, and time boxes. like - 30 min of focused work, no email replies, no JIRA, or anything else.</div>
<div>when hitting decision making roadblock: make a (**) here’s what i haven’t considered and move on. placeholders. placeholders. placeholders. like today with CM mockup. how will toolbars be linked to other pages? like. put a fucking icon there. or mark it somewhere. and just. move. on. so many other components to work on.</div>
<div>and: no more dread at doing. after conceptualizing. think - now i’m doing. this is the real thing. it’s beautiful. it’s fucking beautiful.</div>
<div>i’m a get shit done amazing productivity product team type. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hey a comment from olga ‘did i mention i’ve really enjoyed working with you?’. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>--</div>
<div>okay not work</div>
<div>lately brain feels healthy and sort of interesting. </div>
<div>but why?</div>
<div>here’s why some people don’t write.</div>
<div>they get in front of the paper, and think: what do i write?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>but i don’t know catching odd creative thoughts.</div>
<div>and feeling a weird surge of self awareness</div>
<div>of my body. my brain. my value to others.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>--</div>
<div>sickness</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>energy focusing on clothing lately. wanting to build the fundamentals. really refine just a few outfits and looks. and then move broader. right now? do i have that. definitely some favorite outfits. but not complete complete.</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>12/11</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the new me. the - as of yesterday me. does not randomly binge eat. eats slowly. does not get sucked into minor coding endeavors. moves the fuck on. gets the right amount of sad over girls not texting. feels good about self. acknowledges loneliness while reading thinking doing productive activities. has a tight fundamental wardrobe. the basic pants, shirts, etc, down. accents to fill later.</div>
<div>that’s the new me. (things to work on)</div>
<div>friday arriving home. cargo from an uber. headache dominating brain, negative thoughts taking the small crevices left. hype peace sweater - palace-tine. pretty tight. okay nap.</div>
<div>then off to see moonlight. bringing headphones, not listening to music. but like overall. a-what-do-with myself restlessness. like when i come back home? what then? get high? then?..</div>
<div>off to see moonlight. more beautiful each time as i think back. concise. somewhat insular/slow. but appropriately so. easy to pick out symbolism because structure is so contained. leaving movie and sort of thinking hey what’s a concrete thought i can share with morgan? morgan responding with ‘still processing’ when prompted to comment. respect. how to start a conversation like this without actually providing outright criticisms. need to just open an exploratory space for conversation, rather than exchange facts.</div>
<div>throughout the whole weekend - should i text nour a final proposal to hang out? needing a concrete thing to do. museum that’s cool but like also high commitment and exactly what she had suggested. </div>
<div>thursday sending out a ‘hey wanna hang?’ text to ingrid. surprised not to hear back given responsiveness / ostensible interest..but like this is how it is. (saturday 8am, a lengthy text explaining sickness/business). looking through her photos like hey she’s kinda cute. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>siavash coming home thursday night, bagful of brooks brothers in hand. using taste to understand something broader in his brain. his aesthetic sensibility a difficult thing to figure out. overall, and eye for style. large commonality in determining what is dope. but. two navy pants. one corduroy. ‘black pants don’t make sense’. these statements confusing. and then, a slew of the same lee jeans. overall seem to have a somewhat clunky look. style and fashion and building the fundamentals</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>saturday. coding for a few hours. phone call home for 2 hours, discussing new career switch with baba. trip to umra with seto AND kids that’s a little crazy my friend. proposing maybe in that one week when noor and i back. er. taking 2 long. then chatting with summer and yousuf. don’t want to continue shaming into reading.</div>
<div>after, discussing with adam how mama/baba raising summer and yousuf. no positivity in the household. how family mood dominates. a topic we take through cooking.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back from alex sheng’s. cold in room. book in hand, under covers. siavash lying down on floor, back to pillow. i’m bored with work. well, need to meditate, sleep well, then re-evaluate. and stop listening to ash koosha. completely dominating state of mind. interesting. i engage with music, listen to a lot. strongest physical sensation is goosebumps. but intense heart rate fluctuations. limited to music? no. hm. part of me craving a more intense reaction - despite realizing how limiting this is. in line with self-perception of brooding artist.</div>
<div>rapping in hand: they call me artsy, i don’t make art see, just wearing black heart of black, super hard see… something similar maybe a good start.</div>
<div>after, reading a little, dozing at midnight. 10 hours of sleep into next day. indulgent, maybe a little necessary. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the only other world i’m occupying - outside work - murakami. norwegian wood. drawn in story, as usual. but relatively stripped down. little room for the mind to wander, question and project.</div>
<div>health. headaches all week. gone, sort of, now. slight cold to replace.</div>
<div>wow foodman truly one of the most eclectic albums (sonically, sheer frequencies and styles) i’ve heard in a while</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the latest, potentially apt self analysis:</div>
<div>--</div>
<div>lately listening to more formless, experimental music. maybe because feeling grounded, too grounded, in other aspects of life?</div>
<div>--</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/12</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Writing taking too long last night so ditching to work </div>
<div>Work unproductive. Spending too much time in CSS, making small design choices. N</div>
<div>Calm, collected, and stable yesterday. Length meals as indicator. Towards end of day, confined. Maybe because spent so much of weekend working. Sleeping early, no fulfilling interactions. End of night, post murakami. Awake (too much sleep prev night). And wondering: what to do with me? So calling tanya, talking for over an hour. It's easy with her. Resolve to do 'some crazy shit'/destroy stability. Old days of banging in car, being overall deviant..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>On writing, with Siavash. His first day. Smiling, a fulfilling endeavor. Wondering what his journal is like. Oddly worried about security..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Bringing up podcast about emergency medicine ethics. Siavash talking about how for years at brown questions like this dominated his mind. Now, his focus is things he can apply to life. Fiction in this category too. How butler character in book he just read carries similar though patterns // can learn from his flaws. Me: how applying to personal life gets confining. Admire and enjoy aesthetic beauty. Purely. Escape.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Up early today. Like I never slept sort of. Packing things and deciding to ditch weird blue cheese hummus breakfast sandwich I brought. Dark, rainy, slushy. A photo, and caption, as usual in head.</div>
<div>Gym - rowing hard. 4380m in 20min. Best in a little while. 21 on first set of pull ups (how am I getting better?). Danny Brown orchestrating most of workout.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Watching spiky curly hair man on laptop, click clicking but not really working? Cannot still / must work type.</div>

<div>12/13</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>clear-headedness continues. work. murakami. alternating worlds.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>—last night. abuzz with banter. from 6:30, dropping things off, conversing with vash. adam walking in. jokes, laughter for hours. siavash telling this story about office manager at wayfarer. cute. exchanged quality small talk. that was story. but said introduction like 100x in, many different ways. me bursting in laughter, almost to point of tears. topics of girls, how we’re all going to get drunk - for first time - together this weekend. things like this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>off to bed last night - no longer feeling this slump, inwardness, loneliness. clean, refreshed, happy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today. relatively focused. sort of productive. forgetting how slow css/web dev can be. still chipping away at single patient summary.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>...</div>
<div>continue in the morning</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/14</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At once super awake and spacey. Can pay attention be sharp, but brain, in equilibrium wants to stare off into space.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>grappling the self</div>
</div>
<div>many thoughts today</div>
<div>yesterday, in contrast to today. calm. craving calm. brain relatively empty. thoughts - focused on how self-aware, clear i am. listening to death grips, somewhat deliberately, to fuck myself up, throw myself off get somewhere else escape escape this thing that is me. but me is not me stripped down. me is not the clear, sharp, empty brain. me is the chaos. that’s me. for now.</div>
<div>
<div>today, the turbulence i crave is back. because - i crave that?</div>
<div>talking to siavash, and then later - adam and siyi - about this. how this state that people supposedly seek. of clarity.</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>uhhh beach house. having not listened or saturated self with music. god this is beautiful. swooning immediately. music can really give yourself away to. let the strings pluck you away.</div>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>usual thread of girls girls girls. hey i’m like healthy and horny just lonely that’s not so bad. </div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div>echoing thoughts:</div>
<div>this morning. well this morning. firstly, leaving late, and taking train. because coffee with nick. chatting with siavash. not sure about what. hm. anyway. munching on usual peanut butter coconut flake - eating fast, but super enjoying. easing into the routine, with shower, ginger tea and stretching. caught up sending a lengthy email. and also: basketball teams. casey like: do you want to put down a down payment and sign up? and like, yes sure? but why would you ask question that way. </div>
<div>but. this morning. as in - meeting with nick. not super satisfying. both us, a propensity for the vague and lofty. my concerns of being overloaded with sundry random things not really alleviated. i mean: the concrete tasks to manage = super useful and in line with what i want. responsible for: some HIMSS posters, all CM mockups, potentially managing contractors who will be implementing CM. and the engineering management BS. all great. and what matters really, because the concrete tasks are what i’m actually doing.</div>
<div>company success: biggest investors = GE (who has many EHRs) and Merck. big playas. 32 million budget raise, as compared to 13 previous time. </div>
<div>in this conversation: in such an intense listening mode that i have few comments and retorts.</div>
<div>but the downsides: still up in the air, this ‘product analyst’. er. that’s unfair. i’m an associate product manager. that’s exactly what i am. and i’ve been working hard. also: not standing up or denying nick’s comment about: gaining more context, picking up anything, any random shit. no. i want to be more focused. more focused right. lies directly in contrast to my goal. then vague mentions of tailoring me into a designer, possibly, in the future. now, no budget, for designer. but i can grow to take that capacity. this doesn’t mean i still can’t be an unofficial design evangelist. (does mean associate product designer is totally not in line, so good i moved away from proposing). i guess i’m being bred into a change maker. well money maker, but i tell myself former..</div>
<div>possible: davis office. (or allston noo). </div>
<div>so really, not end of world - just need to make it clear that: i can’t keep picking up random shit. though i do agree with the concrete tasks, do not agree with the short-term broad vision. yes an associate product manager. yes i need more context. but want to be super super good at care management, and use that as a means of understanding customers. so, rather than attending general sales calls, focusing on care management portions of a sales call. well if i work 12 hour days i suppose i can pull it off. (a comment about burnout on the team - err yes. working this hard + doing such rich variety of work, i think i should get compensated like industry avg? especially considering how tiny team is.)</div>
<div>also - wanted to hear more of the 3 year roadmap.</div>
<div>(separately, need to talk to someone about how to have a salary negotiation conversation. who is the right person? not nick. )</div>
<div>oh right the biggest most salient comment. ‘you have a unique brain. very unique. it’s a great thing. you don’t think like most people. but need to make effort to develop empathy of other people’. i guess i’m an alien.</div>
<div>did get a ‘you’ve been doing great, hearing positive things from everyone’. like who?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i’m not talkative but boy do i write a lot. talkativity != brain activity. social goal: make talkativity = brain activity. (tweeting this, then deleting.) </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in murakami’s world. growing entangled in watanabe’s story. character growth. questioning love, nature of his love. for naoko.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today, totally fucking up product feature meeting. firstly proposing ‘enhanced patient registry’ - but NOT the case. immediately, nick contradicting. and the engineers (tim and tark really) just giving a bad energy. like, understanding this whole stakeholder balance thing. like great for that. but god damn, not wanting anything new exciting. would prefer easiest route. status quo. me don’t get u. leaving meeting, debriefing, and breaking down the many ways i fucked up. ahh. and then in triage meeting, no one even playing the game where pretend i can make calls. just - tagging nick and waiting for later response.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking about the creative process i’ve had lately. how incredibly unproductive it can be. thinking of thing, following a million little threads. tweaking and perfecting something else. sometimes the result isn’t bad? showing CM mockup to Nick - and somehow exceeding his expectation? anyway. like 2 months to finish these mockups.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i think i found an aesthetic i think i make sense or is this a fallacy?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>rejuvenated. a little. today. not in wanting to work really. but more romanticization of work, the world. thinking of re-picking up the brain/thought visualization data viz project. how do i start this? thought archival and intense categorization. manually turn into data? or semi-automated?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>be honest with yourself. a vow. a concrete value.</div>
<div>a potential concrete value: from norwegian wood: don’t feel sorry for yourself. only assholes feel that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>writing is a consistent creative outlet. need to start writing stories and other things. or maybe: continue making weird lists. like push myself in this way. is this art? is this self-expression, in a way that isn’t purely literal? is there a such thing as literal self-expression? everything is obfuscated, a chain of many atoms things translating to emotions, thoughts, words, writing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking lately about: self-expression. primarily in light of nick’s comment pointing to website that has ‘my aesthetic’. didn’t realize people picked up on this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sometimes too many thoughts to reign in and organize, i guess could use organization.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/18</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>poetic on a good day, broody on a bad. numb on an average day.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>‘dude i listened to beach house for like 2 hours and just wrote this week’. casey, relaying, my own comment back to me, in coffee shop. overheard in indie coffee shop.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/19</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>stretching writing in the morning. herb tea to get appetite going (breakfast sitting, on table, waiting for me. imagining situation where someone else eats because like why else leave breakfast there). life hack type shit. ezekiel coning’s beautiful ambient music carrying me through. wow. beautiful &amp; life is great.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>most recently, last night. joking around with adam about needing to get with lucy liu so we have more friends. and, immediately prior, conversation with baba. telling him about my work things. getting a little angry - and in retrospect, definitely should not have - over having extended talk about data modeling and its application to retrieving client requirements. and then - summer and yousuf? good. home alone for most of day, but behaving well.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>looking at this pitchfork weird purple graphic, pastel fonts in weird orientations displayed. in love.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a conversation with reef &amp; ruby. easing in. first - things. academy reminiscing. family, holidays. then: design, specifically. how you can supplement with coding. the user experience component. showing a little of my work. after: typing notes and sending. mentorship is kind of fun.</div>
<div>(the way there - disastrous due to santa run blockade. at intersection, waiting, as endless stream of santas run by. jumping out of car, half running (in boots=hard) to forge.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>after, calm late lunch at kebob kolbeh with yahya, siavash, alaleh (and later casey). meat incredibly flavorful &amp; juicy. easy, calm snippets exchanged. after casey joining, relocating to 1369 coffee shop. no space for rest of crew, so sitting down, and having tea. casey, in a routine, but good. things are good. pausing to talk about the girls. casey texting girl for a few weeks now, but has not met up yet. me: describing date with nour and how nail isn’t fully in the coffin. hey, girls, things. (ego lately a bit more satisfied after reply from nour, ‘i love you’ message from julia, and tinder like from cute girl. how tenuous my ego and happiness are).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yahya’s break-up - needing to be on his own. girlfriend too supportive in some ways. became a weak person. siavash, proud of him. aligns with his own personal philosophy. talking for an extended time about having relationship as crutch for self-confidence. </div>
<div>(and then: many jokes about adam’s yellow fever, tinder, girls..sundry banter)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>clear-headed, fulfilling, long day. beautiful.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a quick chat with mama and noor. excited to go to dallas. think, on plane trip: what do i want from this trip. how can i be most considerate.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hey good friends: casey, siavash, adam, and reef. that’s solid. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today incredibly unproductive. why? entire day to work on CM mockups, and very little accomplished. first 3 hours of day, roughly, small tasks, and then taking apart the overall flow i had built. where do notes go? should i add quick notes, quick tasks in? conclusion: quick notes as separate tab. no quick task, just do from main task. and then thinking about: task stacks. so putting in thought into flow. but needing to build. not able to resolve the dissonance, in first half of day.</div>
<div>second half. too many small things to work on. vague direction. no clear design idea in mind. every task to build is small, and doesn’t feel worth it. but that’s because project now is just sum of many tiny tiny pieces. </div>
<div>tomorrow: need to time box. time box. and concrete tasks. link all pages. create full flow. task now &gt; task later. build out calendar. this is all concrete stuff i can do. by end of dallas trip, need to have full two-pane page done. full full. so after flow, and schedule, need to do goal hierarchy on wednesday. how do we convey focus problems that span multiple goals? let’s think about flow, flow tonight. and then tomorrow: concrete goals, and time boxes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>also - need to get outside. and not be so horny while working. real clothing, working out to get that energy out. i feel sharp, calm, good, collected, and i can get things done tomorrow. i know i can. i know i can. &lt;look at this, real confidence</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/20</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>re-listening to this ezekiel koning piece. siavash had shown me with his speakers, joint and wine in hand. impeccable sound design. disparate sounds from everyday life melding beautifully. how did he think to bring this together, thinking? absorbing.</div>
<div>now - on my speakers. still great. but many channeling the initial experience. realizing that hearing on my speakers first would shape subsequent listens..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>with siavash today. a good - 3 hours? of conversation. over cooking, dessert, chilling. first - small things, jokes. then: work and making enough money to retire early. siavash like - you need more than 200k. tanya, receptionist at his work, and why he is no longer into her. suggesting myers briggs test, speaking lightly and somewhat incorrectly about meditation (despite sort of teaching it). then: relaying story of siavash’s former boss prompting to take myers-briggs. siavash morally offended. viewpoint: no doubt that it can show me something, but gives me no information with which to improve, and make a change. me: morally offended (at least initially, when obaydah proposed) just at the idea of getting label. both of offended at the static aspect of label.</div>
<div>then unpacking - really unpacking (siavash doing great job) - statement of ‘people can’t change’ (echoing may’s mom’s statement about alan). how this is largely true. few people find reason to change. fewer find the right tools. for siavash: why are meditation, therapy (possibly writing) the only tools of finding change. self-awareness as the root of this. hm. i don’t know. maybe.</div>
<div>then: how relationships are miserable. but then: maybe just life is miserable? regardless, we have a head start, knowing and carrying this fact. (how me, as a kid, always resolved not to do what my parents were doing in relationship).</div>
<div>(wow, siavash managed to explain and break so slowly, clearly, gradually. perhaps a bit too slowly, but well done. and me - i managed to listen and absorb like 100%. thoughts of smoking dope tonight eradicating as i realize i should probably carry this focus with me the rest of week).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work. hitting a stride maybe around 1pm. morning, same restless, circular thinking that got me nowhere as yesterday. too many ill-defined requirements coupled with barrier to probing further. and an indecisiveness in pushing through the parts that are defined. wanting elegant, beautiful design immediately. but need to just fucking code and produce. so painful to look at an unfinished UI because it feels like i’ve done nothing. the problems are clear. avoided pattern by finding defined problem to work on (calendar) that just needed to be fucking built. found self in flow for a few hours. tomorrow - how will i do this? need to build forms, link pages, and build out goals.  the first relying on aesthetic decisiveness, last on better requirements. hm. smaller things include: changing patient card data structure. fixing scrolling interaction. time box aesthetic decision making for the morning, when i’m not exhausted. research for afternoon, then building. so until 1pm, time box time box time box.</div>
<div>(lol same as yesterday, rereading)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this lo-fi monospace colorful font aesthetic it’s my aesthetic and vibes with me but why?</div>
<div>because i can do it, pull it off? speaks to fundamental casualness. minimalist, creative, logical type mind, in short. does not take itself too seriously. (or maybe, just lack of real talent).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/23</div>

<div>user interfaces user interfaces</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sticky brain notes</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>digital design theory looking at this book at harvard book square. do i like it for my ego or genuine interest? entangled. bit of both.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>tim hacker and daniel lopatin a beautiful combo actually.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i don’t eat slow but i can smoke slow and savor. is that what matters.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>writing can be too much preoccupation with self</div>
<div>looking for memoir at the library</div>
<div>book about hawks this will be hard to get through.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/25 (DALLAS)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Smelly Americans getting smelling dogs</div>
<div>Caving birds fucked up</div>
<div>Words exchanged, between nihaya, Asma, Mama. Meanwhile, raeda watching vine length videos </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>All these samples make you fat</div>
<div>Husbands poorly dressed - except for nihaya's</div>
<div>Repeat joke, broadcast </div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>Every daycare needs camera</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mama funny on the first joke, then it comes 20 more times</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/26</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>up today, 8:30. mama, nihaya in the kitchen. eggs and potatoes a background theme, coming gradually into the forefront. difficult to pull topic of conversation. because - nonstop chatter, with few focused topics. something about: asma probably.  imitations of her. the sighs, helplessness over small matters.</div>
<div>in head: echoing yesterday / baba's family story: seto being 13 when tayseer is 4 (mother dying from chicken pox, father finding new wife). does not consider his mother, hardly visits. apparently somewhat cruel to her. (but also: incredibly impressive that he got to his current position and stature. parkinson's now though, setting in). seto: 7 miscarriages, then 5 daughters (2 sons after). seto, probably around 85. healthy. </div>
<div>eggs and potatoes. delicious, frittata-like texture. eating eating but this time mindful, stopping at right time.</div>
<div>topics of studying and AP and SAT and mama sort of showing off my SAT scores. confusion in understanding her pride towards me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>raeda, living in baton rouge, and yet, expressing real surprise at the fact that there a lot of poor people in america. really? and comment that you need doctor-ish salary to live a good life.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>nihaya calling me her cutie, cute, my cute many many times throughout day.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on a walk with shayma. passing rundown mexican shops, nightclubs. witnessing what might be a drug deal. and talking about gender norms in islam, the pressure to get married and enter unfulfilling relationship for no reason. thread connecting to yahya after break-up - and siavash's reality of miserable marriages.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>an example of ~ frustrating conversations ~. articulating desire to go to nice coffee shop. mama: why not starbucks? why not work here? noor has a nice lounge did you see that? these suggestions thrown out merely to stir arguments. a first layer of frustration. second, not trying hard to actually understand what it is i want. instead imposing what i might want. this second bit perhaps a bit more understandable, as parent difficult to accept child's autonomy? this method of conversation though, too common (same with jobs, throwing out suggestions).  suggesting i become a fancy nurse. what the fuck? do you know what i do? </div>
<div>also - comment that i wasted my biomedical engineering degree.</div>
<div style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">empty, sometimes provocative suggestions and comments as conversation starters.</div>
<div style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">and then - inability to carry out conversation after initial provocation. hopeless. surrender.</div>
<div style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;"><br/></div>
<div style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">snippets:</div>
<div style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">taking voice recording, random voice recording during conversation. and multiple voices talking over each other.</div>
<div style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">asma, orchestrating a lion king holding of her baby, after mama's misguided lion king joke (isn't this like what they did to jesus? no.)</div>
<div style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">burberry baby clothing.</div>
<div style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">raeda taking care of asma's child.</div>
<div style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">she's pretty, she's fat, she's this, she's that</div>
<div style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">preventing conversational loop by telling mama to stop trying to incite me with stupid suggestions. nihaya, mama, sitting back like: wow look how he talks so clear and smart. not. my point.</div>
<div style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">suggesting to get patches for siblings. seeing my shirt and bursting out into laughter. asma, trying immediately to take a snap video.</div>
<div style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">munching steadily throughout the day. can you get the chips from the car?</div>
<div style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">do you want a wife like ? from?</div>
<div style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">costco, sam's club plans.</div>
<div style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">the word 'high class'. hatha high class.</div>
<div style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">a genuine feeling for poor</div>
<div style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;"><br/></div>
<div style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">noor's attractive, intelligent hijabi friend marwa. an affinity for broad, systems-level thinking driving her to do global health fellowship. understanding that my job is 'future of healthcare'. 3rd year resident. oo. rania, a little spacey, nearby, relaying story of ordering orange juice at coffee shop, receiving hipster outrage.</div>
<div style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">work on my job pitch. work on it. for ego, yes. but also</div>
<div style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;"><br/></div>
<div>allowing myself to come up with patterns, delve deep into categorizing people. no need to give benefit of the doubt here - move directly into assumptions. because need to develop toolkit, mobilize, and find best ways of acting to family in thoughtful, considerate way.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>gender norms within a relationship discussed. saying that i will share responsibility for raising kid. do not want 'family-oriented' woman. in parallel, and actually related: baba telling ahmad that noor's money is hers, and that he pays the bills. the concern of needing to withdraw</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>baba as very rational, though using religion as means of negotiating logic. mama, emotional. completely. no clear value basis.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>driving noor's car, imagining life here. feeling ever more thankful for pace, enrichment, and intellectual vitality in my life.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>mindlessly shopping online yesterday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on the mind lately - health. healthcare.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at oak lawn coffee in dallas. a nice, sunny, hipstery spot. in domain of pet stores. a nice place to walk? asking barista. clyde warren park. like, been there. (park suspended in highway-ville).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>incredibly jittery horny leaving coffee shop. this same feeling, perhaps, driving unproductivity when working from home. less strong coffee, more slowly.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>noor's apartment, medical district drive</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>leaving - need to categorize</div>

<div>the thought pattern is: big task -&gt; indecisive -&gt; little task -&gt; not worth my time, little -&gt; little task -&gt; big task. and again.</div>
<div>(not just a problem at work. also the same sort of thinking that gets me to: never reply to messages, send messages on tinder.)</div>
<div>partly a problem of inertia. but not needing to confront the inertia because other thought routes brain creates.</div>
<div>caused by:</div>
<div>+ (in design work) indecision. really just held up. so think. do something else. come back. rooted in bottleneck in logical decision-making. sort of like what alex tran described. not injecting enough emotion here, so really stuck in decision.</div>
<div>+ pursuing a broader picture. like, hey okay i’m going to work on this one page but wait how is it gonna interface with everything else? so checking every other component.</div>
<div>+ knowing what to do. visualizing the solution. but dread at having to implement. like in sql. sometimes doing little adhoc check, instead of sticking to a few concrete sample cases. or writing a modular way to do something. so 2 issues. 1) dread at having to implement when broad imagination type work is done, 2) wanting easy, instant gratification</div>
<div>+ distraction by:</div>
<div>     checking tasks to do (because always outstanding tasks)</div>
<div>     emails to reply to</div>
<div>     doing so, again. because so many little bits that i can forget i already checked one thing.</div>
<div>     also: not finishing the little tasks.</div>
<div>     slack. teams. notification checking.     </div>
<div>     (what do i have to do? what do i have to do)</div>
<div>     just getting up. eating, etc.</div>
<div>     feeling of: what’s the point in doing this when such little time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>okay how i will solve.</div>
<div>create work streams, and time boxes. like - 30 min of focused work, no email replies, no JIRA, or anything else.</div>
<div>when hitting decision making roadblock: make a (**) here’s what i haven’t considered and move on. placeholders. placeholders. placeholders. like today with CM mockup. how will toolbars be linked to other pages? like. put a fucking icon there. or mark it somewhere. and just. move. on. so many other components to work on.</div>
<div>and: no more dread at doing. after conceptualizing. think - now i’m doing. this is the real thing. it’s beautiful. it’s fucking beautiful.</div>
<div>i’m a get shit done amazing productivity product team type. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hey a comment from olga ‘did i mention i’ve really enjoyed working with you?’. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>--</div>
<div>okay not work</div>
<div>lately brain feels healthy and sort of interesting. </div>
<div>but why?</div>
<div>here’s why some people don’t write.</div>
<div>they get in front of the paper, and think: what do i write?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>but i don’t know catching odd creative thoughts.</div>
<div>and feeling a weird surge of self awareness</div>
<div>of my body. my brain. my value to others.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>--</div>
<div>sickness</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>energy focusing on clothing lately. wanting to build the fundamentals. really refine just a few outfits and looks. and then move broader. right now? do i have that. definitely some favorite outfits. but not complete complete.</div>

<div>12/11</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the new me. the - as of yesterday me. does not randomly binge eat. eats slowly. does not get sucked into minor coding endeavors. moves the fuck on. gets the right amount of sad over girls not texting. feels good about self. acknowledges loneliness while reading thinking doing productive activities. has a tight fundamental wardrobe. the basic pants, shirts, etc, down. accents to fill later.</div>
<div>that’s the new me. (things to work on)</div>
<div>friday arriving home. cargo from an uber. headache dominating brain, negative thoughts taking the small crevices left. hype peace sweater - palace-tine. pretty tight. okay nap.</div>
<div>then off to see moonlight. bringing headphones, not listening to music. but like overall. a-what-do-with myself restlessness. like when i come back home? what then? get high? then?..</div>
<div>off to see moonlight. more beautiful each time as i think back. concise. somewhat insular/slow. but appropriately so. easy to pick out symbolism because structure is so contained. leaving movie and sort of thinking hey what’s a concrete thought i can share with morgan? morgan responding with ‘still processing’ when prompted to comment. respect. how to start a conversation like this without actually providing outright criticisms. need to just open an exploratory space for conversation, rather than exchange facts.</div>
<div>throughout the whole weekend - should i text nour a final proposal to hang out? needing a concrete thing to do. museum that’s cool but like also high commitment and exactly what she had suggested. </div>
<div>thursday sending out a ‘hey wanna hang?’ text to ingrid. surprised not to hear back given responsiveness / ostensible interest..but like this is how it is. (saturday 8am, a lengthy text explaining sickness/business). looking through her photos like hey she’s kinda cute. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>siavash coming home thursday night, bagful of brooks brothers in hand. using taste to understand something broader in his brain. his aesthetic sensibility a difficult thing to figure out. overall, and eye for style. large commonality in determining what is dope. but. two navy pants. one corduroy. ‘black pants don’t make sense’. these statements confusing. and then, a slew of the same lee jeans. overall seem to have a somewhat clunky look. style and fashion and building the fundamentals</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>saturday. coding for a few hours. phone call home for 2 hours, discussing new career switch with baba. trip to umra with seto AND kids that’s a little crazy my friend. proposing maybe in that one week when noor and i back. er. taking 2 long. then chatting with summer and yousuf. don’t want to continue shaming into reading.</div>
<div>after, discussing with adam how mama/baba raising summer and yousuf. no positivity in the household. how family mood dominates. a topic we take through cooking.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back from alex sheng’s. cold in room. book in hand, under covers. siavash lying down on floor, back to pillow. i’m bored with work. well, need to meditate, sleep well, then re-evaluate. and stop listening to ash koosha. completely dominating state of mind. interesting. i engage with music, listen to a lot. strongest physical sensation is goosebumps. but intense heart rate fluctuations. limited to music? no. hm. part of me craving a more intense reaction - despite realizing how limiting this is. in line with self-perception of brooding artist.</div>
<div>rapping in hand: they call me artsy, i don’t make art see, just wearing black heart of black, super hard see… something similar maybe a good start.</div>
<div>after, reading a little, dozing at midnight. 10 hours of sleep into next day. indulgent, maybe a little necessary. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the only other world i’m occupying - outside work - murakami. norwegian wood. drawn in story, as usual. but relatively stripped down. little room for the mind to wander, question and project.</div>
<div>health. headaches all week. gone, sort of, now. slight cold to replace.</div>
<div>wow foodman truly one of the most eclectic albums (sonically, sheer frequencies and styles) i’ve heard in a while</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the latest, potentially apt self analysis:</div>
<div>--</div>
<div>lately listening to more formless, experimental music. maybe because feeling grounded, too grounded, in other aspects of life?</div>
<div>--</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/12</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Writing taking too long last night so ditching to work </div>
<div>Work unproductive. Spending too much time in CSS, making small design choices. N</div>
<div>Calm, collected, and stable yesterday. Length meals as indicator. Towards end of day, confined. Maybe because spent so much of weekend working. Sleeping early, no fulfilling interactions. End of night, post murakami. Awake (too much sleep prev night). And wondering: what to do with me? So calling tanya, talking for over an hour. It's easy with her. Resolve to do 'some crazy shit'/destroy stability. Old days of banging in car, being overall deviant..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>On writing, with Siavash. His first day. Smiling, a fulfilling endeavor. Wondering what his journal is like. Oddly worried about security..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Bringing up podcast about emergency medicine ethics. Siavash talking about how for years at brown questions like this dominated his mind. Now, his focus is things he can apply to life. Fiction in this category too. How butler character in book he just read carries similar though patterns // can learn from his flaws. Me: how applying to personal life gets confining. Admire and enjoy aesthetic beauty. Purely. Escape.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Up early today. Like I never slept sort of. Packing things and deciding to ditch weird blue cheese hummus breakfast sandwich I brought. Dark, rainy, slushy. A photo, and caption, as usual in head.</div>
<div>Gym - rowing hard. 4380m in 20min. Best in a little while. 21 on first set of pull ups (how am I getting better?). Danny Brown orchestrating most of workout.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Watching spiky curly hair man on laptop, click clicking but not really working? Cannot still / must work type.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/13</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>clear-headedness continues. work. murakami. alternating worlds.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>—last night. abuzz with banter. from 6:30, dropping things off, conversing with vash. adam walking in. jokes, laughter for hours. siavash telling this story about office manager at wayfarer. cute. exchanged quality small talk. that was story. but said introduction like 100x in, many different ways. me bursting in laughter, almost to point of tears. topics of girls, how we’re all going to get drunk - for first time - together this weekend. things like this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>off to bed last night - no longer feeling this slump, inwardness, loneliness. clean, refreshed, happy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today. relatively focused. sort of productive. forgetting how slow css/web dev can be. still chipping away at single patient summary.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>...</div>
<div>continue in the morning</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/14</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At once super awake and spacey. Can pay attention be sharp, but brain, in equilibrium wants to stare off into space.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>grappling the self</div>
</div>
<div>many thoughts today</div>
<div>yesterday, in contrast to today. calm. craving calm. brain relatively empty. thoughts - focused on how self-aware, clear i am. listening to death grips, somewhat deliberately, to fuck myself up, throw myself off get somewhere else escape escape this thing that is me. but me is not me stripped down. me is not the clear, sharp, empty brain. me is the chaos. that’s me. for now.</div>
<div>
<div>today, the turbulence i crave is back. because - i crave that?</div>
<div>talking to siavash, and then later - adam and siyi - about this. how this state that people supposedly seek. of clarity.</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>uhhh beach house. having not listened or saturated self with music. god this is beautiful. swooning immediately. music can really give yourself away to. let the strings pluck you away.</div>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>usual thread of girls girls girls. hey i’m like healthy and horny just lonely that’s not so bad. </div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div>echoing thoughts:</div>
<div>this morning. well this morning. firstly, leaving late, and taking train. because coffee with nick. chatting with siavash. not sure about what. hm. anyway. munching on usual peanut butter coconut flake - eating fast, but super enjoying. easing into the routine, with shower, ginger tea and stretching. caught up sending a lengthy email. and also: basketball teams. casey like: do you want to put down a down payment and sign up? and like, yes sure? but why would you ask question that way. </div>
<div>but. this morning. as in - meeting with nick. not super satisfying. both us, a propensity for the vague and lofty. my concerns of being overloaded with sundry random things not really alleviated. i mean: the concrete tasks to manage = super useful and in line with what i want. responsible for: some HIMSS posters, all CM mockups, potentially managing contractors who will be implementing CM. and the engineering management BS. all great. and what matters really, because the concrete tasks are what i’m actually doing.</div>
<div>company success: biggest investors = GE (who has many EHRs) and Merck. big playas. 32 million budget raise, as compared to 13 previous time. </div>
<div>in this conversation: in such an intense listening mode that i have few comments and retorts.</div>
<div>but the downsides: still up in the air, this ‘product analyst’. er. that’s unfair. i’m an associate product manager. that’s exactly what i am. and i’ve been working hard. also: not standing up or denying nick’s comment about: gaining more context, picking up anything, any random shit. no. i want to be more focused. more focused right. lies directly in contrast to my goal. then vague mentions of tailoring me into a designer, possibly, in the future. now, no budget, for designer. but i can grow to take that capacity. this doesn’t mean i still can’t be an unofficial design evangelist. (does mean associate product designer is totally not in line, so good i moved away from proposing). i guess i’m being bred into a change maker. well money maker, but i tell myself former..</div>
<div>possible: davis office. (or allston noo). </div>
<div>so really, not end of world - just need to make it clear that: i can’t keep picking up random shit. though i do agree with the concrete tasks, do not agree with the short-term broad vision. yes an associate product manager. yes i need more context. but want to be super super good at care management, and use that as a means of understanding customers. so, rather than attending general sales calls, focusing on care management portions of a sales call. well if i work 12 hour days i suppose i can pull it off. (a comment about burnout on the team - err yes. working this hard + doing such rich variety of work, i think i should get compensated like industry avg? especially considering how tiny team is.)</div>
<div>also - wanted to hear more of the 3 year roadmap.</div>
<div>(separately, need to talk to someone about how to have a salary negotiation conversation. who is the right person? not nick. )</div>
<div>oh right the biggest most salient comment. ‘you have a unique brain. very unique. it’s a great thing. you don’t think like most people. but need to make effort to develop empathy of other people’. i guess i’m an alien.</div>
<div>did get a ‘you’ve been doing great, hearing positive things from everyone’. like who?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i’m not talkative but boy do i write a lot. talkativity != brain activity. social goal: make talkativity = brain activity. (tweeting this, then deleting.) </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in murakami’s world. growing entangled in watanabe’s story. character growth. questioning love, nature of his love. for naoko.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today, totally fucking up product feature meeting. firstly proposing ‘enhanced patient registry’ - but NOT the case. immediately, nick contradicting. and the engineers (tim and tark really) just giving a bad energy. like, understanding this whole stakeholder balance thing. like great for that. but god damn, not wanting anything new exciting. would prefer easiest route. status quo. me don’t get u. leaving meeting, debriefing, and breaking down the many ways i fucked up. ahh. and then in triage meeting, no one even playing the game where pretend i can make calls. just - tagging nick and waiting for later response.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking about the creative process i’ve had lately. how incredibly unproductive it can be. thinking of thing, following a million little threads. tweaking and perfecting something else. sometimes the result isn’t bad? showing CM mockup to Nick - and somehow exceeding his expectation? anyway. like 2 months to finish these mockups.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i think i found an aesthetic i think i make sense or is this a fallacy?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>rejuvenated. a little. today. not in wanting to work really. but more romanticization of work, the world. thinking of re-picking up the brain/thought visualization data viz project. how do i start this? thought archival and intense categorization. manually turn into data? or semi-automated?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>be honest with yourself. a vow. a concrete value.</div>
<div>a potential concrete value: from norwegian wood: don’t feel sorry for yourself. only assholes feel that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>writing is a consistent creative outlet. need to start writing stories and other things. or maybe: continue making weird lists. like push myself in this way. is this art? is this self-expression, in a way that isn’t purely literal? is there a such thing as literal self-expression? everything is obfuscated, a chain of many atoms things translating to emotions, thoughts, words, writing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking lately about: self-expression. primarily in light of nick’s comment pointing to website that has ‘my aesthetic’. didn’t realize people picked up on this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sometimes too many thoughts to reign in and organize, i guess could use organization.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/18</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>poetic on a good day, broody on a bad. numb on an average day.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>‘dude i listened to beach house for like 2 hours and just wrote this week’. casey, relaying, my own comment back to me, in coffee shop. overheard in indie coffee shop.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/19</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>stretching writing in the morning. herb tea to get appetite going (breakfast sitting, on table, waiting for me. imagining situation where someone else eats because like why else leave breakfast there). life hack type shit. ezekiel coning’s beautiful ambient music carrying me through. wow. beautiful &amp; life is great.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>most recently, last night. joking around with adam about needing to get with lucy liu so we have more friends. and, immediately prior, conversation with baba. telling him about my work things. getting a little angry - and in retrospect, definitely should not have - over having extended talk about data modeling and its application to retrieving client requirements. and then - summer and yousuf? good. home alone for most of day, but behaving well.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>looking at this pitchfork weird purple graphic, pastel fonts in weird orientations displayed. in love.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a conversation with reef &amp; ruby. easing in. first - things. academy reminiscing. family, holidays. then: design, specifically. how you can supplement with coding. the user experience component. showing a little of my work. after: typing notes and sending. mentorship is kind of fun.</div>
<div>(the way there - disastrous due to santa run blockade. at intersection, waiting, as endless stream of santas run by. jumping out of car, half running (in boots=hard) to forge.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>after, calm late lunch at kebob kolbeh with yahya, siavash, alaleh (and later casey). meat incredibly flavorful &amp; juicy. easy, calm snippets exchanged. after casey joining, relocating to 1369 coffee shop. no space for rest of crew, so sitting down, and having tea. casey, in a routine, but good. things are good. pausing to talk about the girls. casey texting girl for a few weeks now, but has not met up yet. me: describing date with nour and how nail isn’t fully in the coffin. hey, girls, things. (ego lately a bit more satisfied after reply from nour, ‘i love you’ message from julia, and tinder like from cute girl. how tenuous my ego and happiness are).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yahya’s break-up - needing to be on his own. girlfriend too supportive in some ways. became a weak person. siavash, proud of him. aligns with his own personal philosophy. talking for an extended time about having relationship as crutch for self-confidence. </div>
<div>(and then: many jokes about adam’s yellow fever, tinder, girls..sundry banter)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>clear-headed, fulfilling, long day. beautiful.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a quick chat with mama and noor. excited to go to dallas. think, on plane trip: what do i want from this trip. how can i be most considerate.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hey good friends: casey, siavash, adam, and reef. that’s solid. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today incredibly unproductive. why? entire day to work on CM mockups, and very little accomplished. first 3 hours of day, roughly, small tasks, and then taking apart the overall flow i had built. where do notes go? should i add quick notes, quick tasks in? conclusion: quick notes as separate tab. no quick task, just do from main task. and then thinking about: task stacks. so putting in thought into flow. but needing to build. not able to resolve the dissonance, in first half of day.</div>
<div>second half. too many small things to work on. vague direction. no clear design idea in mind. every task to build is small, and doesn’t feel worth it. but that’s because project now is just sum of many tiny tiny pieces. </div>
<div>tomorrow: need to time box. time box. and concrete tasks. link all pages. create full flow. task now &gt; task later. build out calendar. this is all concrete stuff i can do. by end of dallas trip, need to have full two-pane page done. full full. so after flow, and schedule, need to do goal hierarchy on wednesday. how do we convey focus problems that span multiple goals? let’s think about flow, flow tonight. and then tomorrow: concrete goals, and time boxes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>also - need to get outside. and not be so horny while working. real clothing, working out to get that energy out. i feel sharp, calm, good, collected, and i can get things done tomorrow. i know i can. i know i can. &lt;look at this, real confidence</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/20</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>re-listening to this ezekiel koning piece. siavash had shown me with his speakers, joint and wine in hand. impeccable sound design. disparate sounds from everyday life melding beautifully. how did he think to bring this together, thinking? absorbing.</div>
<div>now - on my speakers. still great. but many channeling the initial experience. realizing that hearing on my speakers first would shape subsequent listens..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>with siavash today. a good - 3 hours? of conversation. over cooking, dessert, chilling. first - small things, jokes. then: work and making enough money to retire early. siavash like - you need more than 200k. tanya, receptionist at his work, and why he is no longer into her. suggesting myers briggs test, speaking lightly and somewhat incorrectly about meditation (despite sort of teaching it). then: relaying story of siavash’s former boss prompting to take myers-briggs. siavash morally offended. viewpoint: no doubt that it can show me something, but gives me no information with which to improve, and make a change. me: morally offended (at least initially, when obaydah proposed) just at the idea of getting label. both of offended at the static aspect of label.</div>
<div>then unpacking - really unpacking (siavash doing great job) - statement of ‘people can’t change’ (echoing may’s mom’s statement about alan). how this is largely true. few people find reason to change. fewer find the right tools. for siavash: why are meditation, therapy (possibly writing) the only tools of finding change. self-awareness as the root of this. hm. i don’t know. maybe.</div>
<div>then: how relationships are miserable. but then: maybe just life is miserable? regardless, we have a head start, knowing and carrying this fact. (how me, as a kid, always resolved not to do what my parents were doing in relationship).</div>
<div>(wow, siavash managed to explain and break so slowly, clearly, gradually. perhaps a bit too slowly, but well done. and me - i managed to listen and absorb like 100%. thoughts of smoking dope tonight eradicating as i realize i should probably carry this focus with me the rest of week).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work. hitting a stride maybe around 1pm. morning, same restless, circular thinking that got me nowhere as yesterday. too many ill-defined requirements coupled with barrier to probing further. and an indecisiveness in pushing through the parts that are defined. wanting elegant, beautiful design immediately. but need to just fucking code and produce. so painful to look at an unfinished UI because it feels like i’ve done nothing. the problems are clear. avoided pattern by finding defined problem to work on (calendar) that just needed to be fucking built. found self in flow for a few hours. tomorrow - how will i do this? need to build forms, link pages, and build out goals.  the first relying on aesthetic decisiveness, last on better requirements. hm. smaller things include: changing patient card data structure. fixing scrolling interaction. time box aesthetic decision making for the morning, when i’m not exhausted. research for afternoon, then building. so until 1pm, time box time box time box.</div>
<div>(lol same as yesterday, rereading)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this lo-fi monospace colorful font aesthetic it’s my aesthetic and vibes with me but why?</div>
<div>because i can do it, pull it off? speaks to fundamental casualness. minimalist, creative, logical type mind, in short. does not take itself too seriously. (or maybe, just lack of real talent).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/23</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>user interfaces user interfaces</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sticky brain notes</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>digital design theory looking at this book at harvard book square. do i like it for my ego or genuine interest? entangled. bit of both.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>tim hacker and daniel lopatin a beautiful combo actually.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i don’t eat slow but i can smoke slow and savor. is that what matters.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>writing can be too much preoccupation with self</div>
<div>looking for memoir at the library</div>
<div>book about hawks this will be hard to get through.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>

<div><br/></div>
<div># - molly, sleep-deprivation, nyc/dc, stef, tanya, romancetalk</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Day before - 12/30 (work, decisions, dillon)</div>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Frustrated at work. Closing tickets but like why is this my job? Brain a knot. Enclosed in decisions, possibilities, but mostly emergent frustration. Stef, after not replying to me saying 'hey I wanna come' saying to just go have fun in NYC. Like no DC. Enough for me to say - okay coming to New York.</div>
<div>Chat with Olga. Sort of warning me / seeing if engineering is really what I want to do. Unsure of staffing but will check going into new year. Chance of joining Josh's team low, as expected. Okay. Frustrated as I leave this talk, wanting change to just happen now.</div>
<div>Also mentioning that usually company doesn't consider changes until like 6 months in.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Okay taxi taking out. Not talking much of the ride (head not feeling) and Stef calling on the way out. Mostly light hearted despite the clear 'I'm mad at you'. Despite principles, Stef agrees to let me visit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Bus ride. Trying to sleep, then attractive young looking girl near me and why not talk head going to explore otherwise. So we talk. For like 3 hours? Name Megan. About our upbringings, college, cities NYC vs Boston. Details. Really pleasant overall (nice bus rides lately).to</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div>What does it mean that in clinging to girls I've dated lately? **revised, clearly, looking for direct self validation!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>NYC and low key. i get in an it’s casual, may almost forgetting to hug me b/c i’ve been around so frequently.</div>
<div>rolling joint, hanging, music, waiting on amanda and clare to show up. clare first. doesn’t really introduce herself. eventually, may out of room, i introduce, ask her a few questions about life (working as waitress, living in bushwick). it’s casual. not aloof. not particularly interested. just like a normal chill whatever type of conversation. amanda over later, rocking gold bling, black nike hoodie. girl got swag.</div>
<div>
<div>Seeing Amanda Clare may interact, reminiscent of Selena and home friends</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>molly - in a tissue - in a taxi. slowly dissolving tissue b/c problems with swallowing (may ‘you would be worst gay man’). get to venue, post coke in bathroom, starting to come come up.</div>
<div>but it’s weird. molly is like a trip. combo of of weed and coke.</div>
<div>at first, thoughts are rampant. like brain is vibrant. i’m thinking of simple this music is, and how algorithmic it can be. and imagining doing some sort of project where i produce edm algorithms. then just thinking about intersections of computer science and music. excited with ideas. and then, data visuals. rather than crazy flashing screens, one visual that aggregates and builds up.</div>
<div>mind shifts a bit as unpleasantness of music seeps in.  brain is on drugs and cool and would love to tap into something more interesting/comforting/enjoying - but faced instead with impending hours of edm. of music being disrupted, stopped and sawed with a repetitive unimaginative, obtrusive beat.</div>
<div>so now focusing on - fighting this unpleasantness. trying to move body, have a good time. for me and for may. and also intellectualizing it: can i have fun, with music i don’t like, crowd in which i feel out of place? can i refrain from judging crowd - who is clearly into the music. hm. not sure if i succeeded.</div>
<div>Imagining these DJs and their lives. How they maintain level of energy. like go into the studio and just - like maniacs, destroy songs and throw on ridiculous beats.</div>
<div>(music likes vines. Quick bursts and abrupt shifts with drops. Not playing any song for very long.)</div>
<div>2:30 am. concert is done. so ready to leave. </div>
<div>walking outside for a while, talking in cold air. mm. and then train home.</div>
<div>at may’s. pj’s. feeling a bit fragile.</div>
<div>making tea for amanda + clare, both enjoying. them, near living room, playing upbeat dance music. me, may, retreated in bedroom. beach house. </div>
<div>confused at how i’m feeling - simultaneous emotions. or at least shifting quickly through deep emotional thoughts and feelings.</div>
<div>nice chat with may, collecting words slowly while listening to music. about: trip so far, how it’s weird dance acid like, difference between me and home friends, talking about how important home friends are. how i feel closer to may (oddly) after college b/c lots of one on one time. our lives at a glance. </div>
<div>(tearing up a little bit, not sure why)</div>
<div>Physical. Little bit of acid body pain tingliness. Heart racing at moments (like i’m falling).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and later - retreating to sleep. all of us (amanda clare too) in bed. imagining cartoons and images in head.</div>
<div>Actually vivid now that im trying to recall.</div>
<div>4 asleep in bed. music off. ears still buzzing, mind still racing, but tiredness taking over.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/31 (NYE in NYC)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Technically workday. So up at 9:30. Shower, tea enough to get me going (and phone wifi) and go through stupid stuff like deployments and minor tickets. heading out for ‘lunch’ - meeting tanya at union square for lunch + coffee. and taking call from steve copans for stupid failing task flow. attempting to parse words amidst ny bustle. (actually solved key issue quickly upon return to may’s).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>may - in the meantime. at home. up and drifting in/out of sleep. later, finding out, that feeling very very down. break up blues, post molly physical shiftiness. i’m sorry, i told may. didn’t address this enough - but didn’t wanna focus on sadness on new years night.</div>
<div>may ordering pasta, me showering. doddling. making tea. etc. like 6:45 heading out to margo’s.</div>
<div>scene: post-college, or some even non-college kids hanging. pretty diverse racially. everyone upbeat, social, happy. rob, rocking fake sailor tat, plaid pants, tie, and white jacket. gf, big friendly eyes, blonde. guy margo is hooking up with - justin. latino i think? voice like andres. </div>
<div>line of coke in margo’s room. me, may, odayn (easy to talk to). talking to uart who is sort of muslim, brother named omar.</div>
<div>overall though, sort of quiet and awkward. feeling way underdressed (wrinkle free button down, ripped jeans, nikes). may looking good, everyone else, sharp sharp dudes in suits etc. letting this dominate my state of mind. margo’s apartment maximalist, art and tasteful knick knacks everywhere. champagne glasses but casual conversation. </div>
<div>coke doing little instill confidence, change thoughts. heading out like 8:30 to meet w/ tanya (deciding not to buy expensive new years package ticket). and sort of staring in the distance in subway, along way. thinking: nothing productive. not super ruminative, but not really seeing happiness, room for play, exploration. post molly? sleep deprivation? down from decision making?</div>
<div>burger king bathroom. bk = seedy. nice person gave me bathroom key.</div>
<div>outskirts of lower east side - gritty gritty, where tanya’s friend krithi lives. animator, indian, worked for huff post then all fellows fired so now adventure time studio? kith’s room: lighting not great, closed in. bed, vodka, basics. tanya making me a drink. her + krithi clearly long headstart. tanya sort of touchy, doing arm hook on walk there. hm. krithi showing video of her animation final video (won award) - nun who slaps censoring stickers for statue nudity. faceoff with cop, who strips, then gets arrested. pretty clever/simply/well done.</div>
<div>leaving for LES bars. east village i think. tanya coming out strong with three cranberry vodkas. conversation, not awkward, but not all that continuous. and as krithi shuffles out tanya pulls me in to make out. at first exciting, but then a bit embarrassing. a bit too intense (hair pulling involved, little bit of dick fondling under table). hm.</div>
<div>despite sizable alcohol, feeling lucid, sober, and a bit like - why what where what am i doing?</div>
<div>hopping to the next bar. girls drinking mainly water. jesse + jackie + christian + mike + jeff (hardly, ptfo level drunk) come by. it’s okay. we talk. explain odd situation at hand. and small talk and whatever. midnight countdown a bit disappointing. on the street. woo. then pizza (down). and little bit of hanging, on to the next bar. top story. christian deciding to hit on girl with ‘you look familiar’. her friend, skeptical, asks me, do you know they’re gonna hook up? emory grad, super personable and earnest (and sober). pretty cute. deciding to head out like 1:30, saying bye to her + others. julia telzak on the way out. a few words of platitude then fuck cab get me out.</div>
<div>home. sitting and stretching. shortly, may in. we briefly debrief. pass out like 2:30.</div>
<div>up at 7.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>----</div>
<div>jan 1, 2016 - nyc -&gt; dc</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div>why do I write notes of things people tell me wh n I'll never look it up?</div>
<div>waking up today - surprisingly easily - at 7 am - for DC trip. Past Royale corridor, doorman opening, feeling like I've developed a routine. Maybe time to leave the city. Visitor for a while.</div>
<div>sleeping through most of bus. girl next to me same deal. overhearing later from phone convo, coming over for little sister’s bday.</div>
<div>in dc at noon. not really feeling walk, despite new surroundings. but observing anyway, with bag slung around neck. streets wide, spread out. some decrepit old buildings but overall everything pretty polished and new. confusing.</div>
<div>get to stef (past basketball court on corner). go inside. vibe of house sort of reinforcing state of mind. dark. no sunlight. no lights even really. and stef room lighting sort of harsh and painful. lying on her bed for a while. sort of drifting into fake nap. massaging stef turning into hookup eventually. pretty nice.</div>
<div>but still, dark heavy dull feeling in the air. the lights, the lack of sleep, post molly, post unfulfilling new years.</div>
<div>shuffle out of the house (after shower) for lunch. the trist. one of these multipurpose chill zones that dc has. bar, restaurant, couches and work area, and music. chaotic but kind of cool. (short chat with lady in line to bathroom, talking to more strangers). butternut squash flatbread - pretty delish with coffee in giant cups. fulfilling &amp; nice.</div>
<div>then - find our way to another coffee shop? compass. hip &amp; clean. dc clean hipster aesthetic. coffee good, actually tasting the notes! (of strawberry). remember conversation maybe being more lively at compass?</div>
<div>streets sort of dead, post new years. but walking around and seeing different areas.</div>
<div>back home. chilling. half napping. half hooking up. or full hooking up? </div>
<div>more multipurpose chilling at busboys n poets. feeling the vibe here more. more ethnically diverse. ordered main and two sides - halloumi thing, butternut squash thing, quinoa and veggies. okay overall, could probably make same quality of food. but vibes are good. some people working, some chilling, some alone, some on dates. cool mix. stayed for a little while, then home for inside out. 1 hr in and then tired, tap out, sleep.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>1/2 (dc day 2)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>up like - 12 hours later?</div>
<div>city a bit more alive today. sunnier, people out and about.</div>
<div>taking a while for stef to get out of bed. ready to get up but still pulling me and sort of having bad sex in morning - well, just deciding to end at certain point. finally out at like 1pm. to smithsonian. coffee shop + bagel. same roasters as diesel. a bit too miniamlist-brutalist-warehouse-hip. tables down to like hip height, tiny chairs. long corridor, light filtering to smaller amounts as you walk through. feeling - static. no rush to go anywhere. but should seize day.</div>
<div>meeting w vira. date and how she used the lesbian card. life here, life there. lira’s job. applying to grad school.</div>
<div>chatting to stef’s rommate ben. us cooking, munching. him, making potato. how dc doesn’t have distinctive vibe. his job, in depth depth. the many different stakeholders in relaying government information.</div>
<div>then - sparked by lira’s parting question of how our dating lives are going, asking who / whether we’ve seen other people/ stupid questions like are others better than me in bed or are you more attracted to others. stef saying yes then no. irritated by question so saying yes? shouldn’t have to validate me / say i’m the best. getting red and extremely bothered and in circular ruminative thought mode and realizing that, even now i need a lot of self validation. need to fix that.</div>
<div>late night. hanging with delia (hot), simba (tall lanky well-dressed chill). to bar that looks like one we went to with emma in brooklyn. pinball machine. pretty fun actually. at table. me and ben seated on low chem bench stools, others towering over us. banter.</div>
<div>back home. picking up conversation again but letting it drift away eventually and tiredly hooking up. frustrated because conversation. but tender notes as we go to bed.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>1/3</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>early morning flight. 45 min of sleep. out to airport in uber. sleeping preflight, sleeping through flight. zombieng through. </div>
<div>run into angela on walk back and not really socially capable. about to crash.</div>
<div>arrive, hop near taxi station. get in, inquire about fare - and partly per new year’s res to take control, be decisive - hop out and take public transport. silver line confusing. bus train thing. home in about 45.</div>
<div>zombieng in productive way now. groceries + picking up hemmed pants. home, cooking cooking cleaning. laundry, then ptfo. with intermittent texts to may (explaining how dc was weird, hearing how post new years was immediately sad but better not) and stef (thanks for visit?).</div>
<div>(siavash out and about)</div>
<div>ptfo.</div>
<div>up, picking up laundry. buying apollo chukka shoes, doing this.</div>
<div>pangs of emotion. indicator: almost tearing up from inside out? something must be off hmm..</div>
<div>ending of inside out. good. pace shift. less back and forth choppy predictable  symbolism/personification of emotions and more adventure, melding of emotions and situations. heartwarming.</div>
<div>gym + tasty salmon dinner (eating slowly enjoying) + texting stef. musings really, and discussion of inside out.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>debate in brain - what is the value in writing down/recalling conversation with people? </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>day ending and now - looking at this past trip in context of what i wanted - to get out of head, to learn/grow, to come back to work motivated and with some direction.</div>
<div>melancholy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>moving forward:</div>
<div>changing journal</div>
<div>more day-day work goals</div>
<div>more snippets (overheard at work, out of context, random things, just write them down)</div>
<div>new years:</div>
<div>+ stop being flaky. Be clear about plans to people, and communicate/don't ignore texts</div>
<div>+ be decisive in when decision is broken down, becomes arbitrary. (today at grocery store, decent example)</div>
<div>+ get to job/position that is creative / what i want. or have a plan to get to that.</div>
<div>+ BE BETTER TO FAMILY</div>
<div><br/></div>
