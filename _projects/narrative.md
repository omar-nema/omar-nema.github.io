title: narrative<br>research
time: summer 2014
heading: As part of my internship with Charles River Analytics, I worked on SONNET - a project that attempts to merge narrative research in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and marketing in order to create useful predictions and suggestions for writers. I was asked to develop a framework for quantifying narrative attributes. My role in the project was primarily in design and direction, as well as... Collaboration with Benjamin Bauchwitz (MIT '15).

        <p>WHY
        
    By aggregating research, Charles River Analytics hopes to develop conceptual links between research from disparate fields. Once this research bank is robust enough, users — the users here being story-writers, or marketers — can input their desired response from a narrative, and receive suggestions from different research studies. (A user looking to induce, say, empathy in their audience, may receive a suggestion to include a certain type of character revelation.) In addition to receiving writing suggestions, a writer can also work backwards — that is, test the physiological and psychological, responses to narratives in a user, and see what kind of responses the user is producing. 
Rather than relying on subjective measures like surveys, researchers can quantify psychological responses to narratives using this tool.

        I was hired to expand the bank of 'narrative research' to feed a software product, I stepped back a bit to re-define the problem - wher
        Narrative research has been conducted in the fields of cognitive psychology, marketing, and neuroscience — but has yet to be integrated in a useful way.
