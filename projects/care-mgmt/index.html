            American healthcare incentivizes procedures: sicker patient populations often result in higher revenue for hospitals. In my day job, I work with organizations that are shifting to <a href="https://www.nextstepsolutionsinc.com/what-is-value-based-healthcare/">value-based care models</a> that instead compensate for positive patient outcomes.
            <span class="info-tooltip">
              Value-based care necessitates holistic (addressing social needs) and preventive care. 'Care Management' programs are aimed at filling the gaps in care that a doctor does not typically provide: coordinating services, addressing social needs, and ensuring engagement with doctor recommendations. Typically, social workers and nurses work to fill these needs.

          For the past two years (2017 onwards), I have been leading product development for Arcadia's care management suite. <strong>The product enables clinicians to provide multi-faceted care - addressing medical, social, and housing needs.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I designed the interface (UX, visual, and product), reporting model, and workflow automation engine. I've also managed its implementation - both externally with care teams, and internally with the engineers executing on development. The product continues to scale, and is now used by more eight large healthcare organizations (with patient populations that range from 100,000 to 1 million).

              </p>
              <p>
                Structurally, the care plan is a set of goals (i.e. 'Improve Patient's Diet'), with actionable interventions used to achieve those goals ('Start cooking daily', 'Track calories').

                Designing the care plan structure was challenging - as I had to adhere to clinical guidelines, administrative desire to track structured information, and user desire to take unstructured notes. The solution I devised - the Care Plan Review form - turns the Care Plan into a structured questionaire, with room for free-text notes.

Clinicians use multiple tools in their day to day, and we wanted to ensure that this tool did not impose - but instead seamless integrated with their other tools.

          The Care Management web app is used by all members of the care team except for the primary care physician. Doctors are restricted to using Electronic Health Records (EHR) as the primary way to view patient documentation. Most EHRs do not (easily) allow for bidirectional interfaces,  so we had to get creative in brainstorming a way to get care management information in front of the provide

          After months of R&D and prototyping, my team and I arrived at a new product: Arcadia Desktop. The product is a native windows application that scans the provider's screen, looks for patient identifiers, and then surfaces a notification stating that Arcadia has additional data on the patient.
          </p>
          <p>
          Clicking on the notification will surface a small overlay screen containing insights and documentation from the Arcadia Care Management system.

          After observing the product in action for one year, it started to become clear that certain parts of the care management workflow are repetitive. We wanted to eliminate the repetitive, administrative, portions of the job, while still giving the user the flexibility they need to make clinical decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
          After a series of in-depth user interviews, I designed, prototyped, and build a set of rules to automate repetitive tasks. The ruleset is expansive, covering clinical indicators (conditions, risk factors), organizational structure, and workload balancing. I translated the rules to a functioning proof-of-concept (data model, and stored procedures), which my team fleshed out further.

          The resulting automation structure is powerful, and highly configurable. One example use case: accomodating a transition from an inpatient hospital visit to home. In realtime, our automation procedures look for any discharge event pulled into the Arcadia system. It then assigns someone to the case based off their attributed location. A notification will be triggered, and an assessment task (aimed at addressing the patient's needs) will be added to the user's calendar. The assessment tasks will then trigger a series of 'care plan goals' for the care manager to work with the patient and address.

            Tracking performance is critical to directing a care management platform. To meet this need, I designed and built a series of reporting tables (in SQL). The tables are intended for analysts to use in a self-serve fashion, and include: workflow metrics, longitudinal outcomes reporting, and product usage. I've compiled findings from these tables into adhoc reports and Tableau dashboards. Shown
