1-10. plane to lisbon. right now you are (broad broad broad) 24 years old. sitting on dark plane, screen tilted, dimmed, writing. blasting kendrick and thinking of last summer. right now you are: 24.5 years old, living alone. your social life contained. a girlfriend - beautiful, grounded, smart. semi-fit. concerned with your appearance, the length of your face. friends are scattered, different, thoughtful, beautiful. style is better. you are a designer. a decent one, but not a great one. you are: somewhat talented at your job given the constraints (age , lack of experience). you are: feeling more close to family. you are: pierced, on both ears. you are: okay with your body, mostly. you are: thinking of aging. you are: less afraid of self-categorization. less afraid of you. first hour, drifting drifting, tim hecker, drifting into sleep. next 30 - rereading neuromancer (because, forgetting since it has taken me too long). much more enjoyable on reread. the environment making sense. 2 glasses of wine. awake despite no coffee. well 2 matcha. matcha, today, at nine bar. prior to trip, looking up: spain. things to do. neighborhoods. alternative things. things. lady clumsily bumping into headphone while walking by. and then noticing:: she has neck brace. the nth lesson in withhold judgment. now - damn, kendrick playing. last summer flooding in memory. listening to damn on headphones near charles / mgh station. 'fear' playing. windy. not recalling hanging out, laughing, or any sort of concrete action. just the mental state i was in while listening. not easily described with words at my disposal. something like: living, carefree, grounded. energy is outward. feeling environment, absorbing taking engaging. energy spilling. less controlled. take it. you, have it. i don't care. take it. other songs in album evoking this same feeling, though with less clarity. and now, energy limited, contained. deliberate. an entity that requires thought to release. comes out on its own, but only when many factors constructively interering. on the airplane, time feeling slower, beats slower, linger. the background in 'element'. the bass dropping slower. can pull it all apart. 'humble'. coming out before summer. but seeing the video. and feeling that mmph. 3x plays, bopping, ugh ugh. 'loyalty'. outside at some park. mystic park or something. with: eric, ahmed, siavash, arash. bumping out of the bluetooth speakers. smoking elevated, near the rocks. watching the kids. mush of conversation - easy, heartfelt - as i'm jamming. 'love'. simple and catchy, but from kendrick. questioning the indie in me. 'blood'. high, in my room, with arash, adam, siavash. blasting blasting the album for the first time. others drifting into sleep. cut to: describing album release party to alisse. alisse: is an observer. alisse: i'm okay with your mood swings. just how you express your emotions. think she means it. be honest with yourself. a sudden bout of - reflection - lately. spill ooze ooze. brain__spill. in logan. eating at generic healthy fast food place. as if mottos were generalized, copied from something, somewhere. and seeing that all workers there are 3arab. receiving the 'chicken chopstick bowl' (no chopsticks included, or available). mishearing the hijabi handing food to me. and self-conscious, the 'am i real arab' thoughts surfacing. coupled with: a thank you / shukran mumble. knowing your limitations: is what is needed for success really. because: world is replete with resources (to learn or do). i just need to know what i need. i need to know what i'm poorly. the thought prompted by early days as designer. got a lot of direction from nick. saying something like 'having trouble starting design language, plz help. back to the involution design sessions. how do our designs compare? what's thoughtful about theirs? how did they deal with care plan? i suppose the same as ours. care plans - biggest gap in new care mgmt features. needs to be: more condensed. task checklist will work maybe, if we make it easier to add new intervention. (just add the care plan restyle into 4.15, no approval needed). do what i need to make this good. add UX tickets. do it. be rogue. also: need a design sprint between 4.16 and 4.17. *link to care plan review, directly from care plan page. *link to portions of care plan review from care plan page. like 'add note to goal'. hm. *how can we actually train people to use this?  everybody (alisse especially) leaving boston prompting me to think of next step. next step. in my professional career. this is where i am. feeling super thankful for job this week. partly after going on / ranting about how i'm lucky to have it, saturday night at saloon with alisse. but also: imagine i didn't get this. where i would be. at a company. slowly climbing the ranks. maybe a newly crowned senior analyst. maybe back in school doing CS. or at an okay design school. all to prep to get to: where i am now. okay dangerous tendencies in relationship: . - always putting hanging with alisse over others. or: not fully committing to spreading out, getting into a chill session. lingering in the back of head: need to see alisse by end of night. - not spending as much time doing the tangible things that i have discernment in / use as means of self-gratification. design projects. - not writing. really: moving my vaidation from above to alisse. i suppose not terrible. like if we break up, a transition period where validation moves back to above? or maybe, entire self destroyed, dissolved. nick like 'i trust you..well, i trust you now' when it comes to design. agreeing. like damn i really sucked. and still not a 'good desgner'. just a decent one, that can make something intuitive. but not beautiful. pleasant. work on that work on that. nick: truly amazing at his job. but also: work and then sleep. how does he feel about this? what is his relationship with girlfriend like? does he talk of work developments?  bad work things. committing to loading goals, interventions, but erm not getting it done in time. and now leaving leaving. nick taking this well, on appearance. but me: not really apologizing. just like. no. this isn't gonna happen. not smiling at people. reaching out. asking about their days. being social. ambitions naturally change in winter, way more productive. it's true it's true. recalling all the shitty stories i wrote in 'fiction i'. how can i get to be a better fiction writer?  and: conversation with yahya day before yesterday. talking about: visa situation. yahya accepting that he will likely be immigrant for much of his life. asylum case in 1.5 years. yahya - always speaking at a broad / philosphical / reflective level. his progression with meditation. clarity. yahya's point that meditation brings you clarity, which grounds, you, makes you feel good. discussing a 'hypothetical' example - how do you deal with case in which you're unhappy about appearance? yahya echoing an idea that it's better to know that you're ugly? do i agree? the healthy, meditation-based process: okay, do looks prevent me from what i want to get? (success, girls, a: no?). do i actually look bad or is it just me? . spending 5 days in a row with alisse. all quite good. great sex the whole time. except last day. working, alisse keeping company. eating with her. not much to talk about but like relaxing and chilling and i think it's good? stretching, too. seeing how: good chilling isn't really sustainable though. spending more time will inevitably sacrifice the quality. what arises instead: a coexistence that can maybe be beautiful? or: you live together, but lead busy lives in which the respective selves of fulfilled irrespective of partner (douchey wording). these thoughts leading me into marriage? can i / one / mostly i have an _actively_ happy marriage. yes underscore = italics. feeling like i'm less idealistic. (don't say that, don't say that). getting ride with alisse to airport. a quickie, prior to leaving.

phrases. caught in the loop. escape the loop. my goal. my life is just wanting to escape the loop. like make a nice loop, and then escape it. or. parameterize. a loop with variables. opportunities to exist. re-enter. re-enter a slightly different loop . —. my loops are good. work, gym, friends etc. the underlying structure / what i miss as result is danger. we have to keep loops. so like above is the approach needed for fulfilling life. . — . podcast today about bubbles. getting caught in a bubble. guy in sf with prestigious job feeling trapped by his beautiful life. the structure of our lives determines who we are. a terrifying thought. for someone whose self worth is predicated on: turbulence, creativity, and originality. . my approach to exiting the bubble is..?  —. lately, hearing myself more often. this is a bad thing. — . same as lately, lately, checking myself in every mirror and combination / permutation of self. . like. seeking truth in aesthetics through exposure. . but maybe that’s not the right approach. getting nowhere. believing that others think i’m cute. but why. my face is long it’s still long. can we take the features and restructure? . but no a couple days this week sort of liking face. —. feeling less the tangibility of money. —. lately the glow of screen, the small red number with notifications - addictive. — . yesterday: presenting care management stuff to bidco. of course, not going to use most features in near future. but direction is right. affirming as designer. my innovation (though simple) - the care plan review form is what’s important. just need to ensure that design gaps are filled. . leaving. and seeing myself, from career perspective. getting ready (searching everywhere for wallet). and then a text from alisse like: can you figure out dates wanna book hawaii if necessary now. then: actually tentative plan is to be in hawaii can do something in between family trip. going off to get drinks for kelly evan’s goodbye, texts lightly lingering in my head. talking with uber driver about his career. machinist. now uber driver. immigrated age 10. 30 now. colombian. hard worker. at bar. texts lingering, anyway, but not too bothered. alisse still seems keen to travel, but has just booked lots. then: grasping that she is booked like end march on. and that she’s not like really inviting me. and that she’s gone soon. but mostly, that she’s not responding to passive aggressive messages. . kelly (o’brine) noticing my look before leaving. and talking through everything with me. clear, i guess, that i want to stay with alisse. but for her. or for ego?  talking to kelly but also just studying her face and her pupillary distance and oh okay i guess it’s attractive even though narrow like mine. —. new porches album = perfect for mood. —. good things with alisse. dinner with her and vira wednesday. chatting chatting good whatever cool normal. then vira leaving. good sex &amp; hangout. alisse looking at me in my eyes. deeply. i feel close. asking me to make plans to travel in may. okay. she really likes me. today though. not sleeping. loop / frustration with alisse her not caring. bad mood all day. face looks bad. things are not interesting. eating pretzels. can i just do more checklist items?  —. okay. going to talk to alisse. about travels. right right. but probably also more than travels because march she leaves leaves. so: do we want to stay together?  well. no. okay. first, the travel things. - i’m upset you invited me to travel, gave me an ultimatum, and then closed ultimatum (okay i’m just gonna go to hawaii). increasingly exclusionary. is this just like being casual and noncommittal or just non enthusiastic about traveling with me. - why did you decide hawaii before family trip if it’s more expensive?  - you should be more inviting if you really want me. you left no room to speculate with me. it’s all: if you wanted to plan something can fit you in. but okay this is more than travel:. - this is the first indication (in my eyes) that you care about me (why haven’t you told me still that you like me?). - also: you’re gone, effectively, from end march. and then your lease ends in jun. and that sucks and it’s upsetting. . next year. - i feel so close and intimate with you. in tune. physically, emotionally. like: i feel passionate about you romantically. but also practically. i think i can grow with you. . = now me, now. thinking about career this past week. the exposure i have is incredible. i still have lots of room to grow (1-2 years). realistically, i think, i want to stay here at least 1 more year. - i haven’t weighed these two things together. partly because i wanna know where you’re at. but. i want to explore being with you. okay. really, probably, what is driving my mood is a fear that alisse does not want to stay with me. but what if she doesn’t want this?  . 2/1. . mama’s bday. a call in the morning, on drive home. making cookie’s for kiddies. baba at beach with friends. nothing for mom planned. her bday not a bday. ‘how did you know it was my bday?’. i remembered mama. i remember. . this, after morning with alisse. sad face at my leaving to gym so quickly? but then - not mobilizing quickly enough. and so not able to make gym. alisse like: you should have gone. but honestly not phased. maybe like happy she wants me there. . don’t let yourself dissolve into relationship ether. less: gym, projects, me. but only 1.5 months of alisse. so whatever. . last night a bday day for alisse. in meeting: rhoda talking about her research is low priority. contradicting previous guidance and making alisse feel useless. (a talk, saturday, when may was here, about how alisse wanted explicit support twice: once when telling me she needs hug/had really bad day, and other time, when telling about sexual assault. me, draining support from her like all the time.) so had to show support. tasty momo with alisse for dinner. cuddling with her + cat momo for a while. talking about things things good sex falling asleep cuddling waking brushing teeth back to sleep up again hey cutie hey girl i really like you i wake up to you i like to wake up to you. . . now, kamasi washington playing. a mini yoga session now. a gym session in the morning. i need the gym. . my face long. these glasses make them longer, maybe. i don’t know. but my face is long it’s true and it’s factual. a comment by alisse. how my face made my hair look long. and then: morgan comparing to me ‘some guy in friend’s band, a doppelgänger’, who, it turns out is simon rodrigues. and like: i’m okay with that / i get it. but a bit about how his face is ‘a little wider’. they see. they see my narrow face. how does anyone like this face. and: exposing to alisse all these insecurities. because, during sex, thinking she’s not feeling it, when she totally was, and really just channeling my insecurities. . but no your face is okay some people think you’re cute? . . how many selfies / mirror stares to grow fond of face? so far in the hundreds, maybe thousands?

(the context - talking aboutt bidet/poops - farts - openness about that in a relationship). and maybe adding self-improvement advice in there for her to show i’m not the only flawed one. lots of time afterwards, me explaining how that was hurtful. in a cutting, rational, emotionally aware sort of way. okay i thought about that way too many times like 100x. not super weighing on me but a thing to think about. and then weighing on me maybe. (a tweet. today - inspired by mira gonzalez to tweet). . how jesse talked about how she was doing lots of work and then moved to big company and actually just realized she was not doing thing right and that quality was just lower (even though she had way more responsibility) . . today listening to podcast on which woman describes herself as shy, anxious - but also, has online presence being super self-effacing and embarrassing. how this, for her, serves as defense mechanism. because any criticism is unsurprising if you tear yourself apart. can relate. . a sudden momentum to switch to spotify. . giving thoughts legitimacy. a tricky thing to think about. . quite horny these days. weird. not even caffeine. or happiness bursting or anything. penis just want it. . missing alisse a lot. okay i do really love her. the practicality of love, thinking about it a lot lately. today, the two weeks ago thought stream of - should i even stay w alisse not arab/muslim who am i / identity / family all that - so foreign and like oh i’m me doing me what else chill don’t think 2 hard. supposed to write lots about that lately. oscillating a bit between: this girl is amazing and grounded and perfect on the important things vs where is my weird slightly destructive artsy romance. the latter - stupid. i think. . how you can overthink ui when you’re designing because so many tis just like okay. . this sudden realization that i talk a certain way, repeat certain phrases, things. . thinking a lot about application headers. okay sudden inspiration to redesign header. done. best version yet. . letting work fill the void friendships. dangerous?  . forth wanderers sound 2 good. . lunch with abhi me not present just like wowzie staring and occasionally listening super intensely then just wandering. . eating too fast lately all the sort of obsessive behaviors popping up. goal: kill these before hawaii, so i can enjoy travel trip me etc. . 5-6. . sink, i think, dripping. . looking at stowe places. lira’s rec. mornings: today, yesterday, lately, tea &amp; foam roll, breakfast. oh and cleaning up. . day beautiful. . thinking: i really should go to grad school. reasons not to = can just do stuff on my own (yes, true, but won’t be in the presence of creative weirdo smarties), no moneys (that’s okay), over qualification (that’s real). but really: master’s not worth it, unless lots of funding (the ideal). . super extremely horny yesterday like wake up from nap and bursting, need to do this before picking up guru the caterer. . this thought, weighing on me of: structured social interactions. dominate life moving forward. like i know this / knew this. but: internalizing, observing this now. because: casey, eric, vira leaving. no parties / crazy last nights out / etc etc. partly the atmosphere of this city maybe too. well no, don’t blame the city. but: incredibly sad. . looking up: above knee pain, behind knee pain. . when high today: thoughts for the twitter. but, did not write down. . easing restless yesterday. bike ride, hike, chilling outside with vira. euphoria. beautiful day. bike bike. ‘you bike like you drive’. hills. oof. wandering. a snake, running. snacks, joint, settling into the rock. chickpea collage, trader joe’s snacks spilling. not recalling what, exactly, but scattered, fun thoughts. ones for the insta. how talking about other people is a way to bond, get closer with the person you’re around. . . routine makes me sad. happiness is possibility.

maybe pulling grass. grass blade he is pulling is mid transition so still can talk. name is tooshie. also tooshie is like hey that hurts. and as this is happening, boy is distracted, his propeller cap flies away. and two themes converge: inattention to harm he is causing, and connectedness to larger ecosystem around him. boy having epiphany. meanwhile, propeller cap flies off boy, lands on plant. plant smiles. end of story. . maybe i should do a thing like - start with a prompt. and new story, everyday. creative therapy. less i focus on me, more i can think about me rationally. . keep in mind: the good lessons from acid. . self awareness in a good way. like detaching self from self and like oh i am this person alisse loves and i’m real and 3d and she sees me touches me and that our love is pretty less fragile than i imagine. . view jealousy as irrational. logic is your way out. . maybe -

morbid curiosity . going on quora for answers to my insecurities. self-love vs selfish. i need less of the latter (maybe not thaat much less), more of former. <br clear="none" />. okay. need to actually work on my thinking patterns. 'official love myself / insecurities document' - work to prevent thought patterns. but also need to build a library of positive thoughts. <br clear="none" />. ideas:. datavis therapy. <br clear="none" />. ultimately i think self-love should be fundamental. but i suppose i could build it up through situations?

<note><title>2018-8-20 interventions</title><content><![CDATA[<en-note>hey -. . some thoughts about — what i need to do to better support you. there are other things you talked about today too, and i want to talk about that later. . . you:. —. apart from family - you are the most important person to me. i care about you so so much. i go to sleep thinking about you, dream about you. i picture what you’re up to throughout the day. i make yelps because i really cannot find an adequate way to show you how much i love you. . you are in a new place, doing new things, doing well -- but also surrounded by people you’ve just met. your family is at home, your grandmother is sick. and you’re unable to see her. your boyfriend talks to you everyday, but never checks in. in fact, just shares his own problems (many of them trivial - requiring your comfort and emotional energy). . deserve a partner who knows how you’re feeling, who is anticipating your feelings, and trying to make you feel better. who helps you process your emotions and think through them. and makes you feel good, loved, and comforted. . . me:. —. . i’m going to include you on what i’ve been thinking - but, i don’t expect any response. i will work through this by myself, with friends, and with a therapist. you’ve provided way too much guidance, energy, and patience, and i don’t want to take more of that. . we’ve had a conversation about supporting you four times previously - and four times i felt extremely upset, guilty, and ready to change. i’ve said this is unacceptable, that this isn’t something i need to work on, but that i need to address this issue now. why haven’t i be become better at supporting you?  —. let me pick up at the last time we had this conversation. i remember how upset i was for you, and how urgently i wanted to make you feel comforted and loved. like i had so much love for you in me, i just wanted you to see it, and feel it. i would stay up, waiting for the next day to come, so i can be there for you. i made sure to ask you about your grandma was doing, how things were at home. to listen, and ask you again. for a week or two. and then i stopped. ever since you started med school. . i think: urgency was driving me to make these changes. i knew you were upset, i desperately wanted to make you feel better. and things became better (not actually - i mean, the urgency just went away because i was showing you support). and then i stopped asking. clearly - this was not a wake up call for me. each four of those times that we discussed me supporting you better, what i felt was more and more <span style="font-style: italic;">gravity</span>. i have a lot of confidence about how much i care about you / how i can express that. i thought that, with how much i love you and care about you, i would automatically adjust and be better for you. i did not go deeper in realizing what i’m doing wrong, what sort of issues are causing me to act like this. so — i didn’t actually identify anything specific that i needed to work on, beyond just ‘showing you that i care’. . that i was relying on urgency is: appalling. makes me sick thinking about this. that i’m only ready to comfort you only when you outwardly feel really bad, and explicitly tell me that? it’s not just bad support. it’s mean. . . there are some underlying issues that i need to address. this is not casual, this is not temporary, this is an intervention. (lack of) self-awareness is part of the problem (i’ll get to that in a bit) - but the bigger issue i think is that i am being too selfish, and not focusing enough on you. on your emotions. our dynamic is too much ‘you supporting me’. to change that, i want to: run any emotion problem/insecurity that relates to you by myself (writing), and a friend first. i want to bring less of my emotional weight. and ask you more about how you’re feeling (not just what you’re doing, and how you feel about specific situations). i want to focus more on your emotions, and less on mine (and not at all on irrational ones). also - i need to shatter this idea of you being ridiculously emotionally sound - this does get in the way of exploring your feelings. . . i need to work, also, on being more self-aware, and understanding what basis my thought patterns have. i will to go to therapy, to talk to friends, and write everyday (about how i’m feeling, and what i did, and whether i’ve been good to you). these are structured things that i can schedule, prioritize, and do. i am confident in that. . there is no doubt in my head about how much i care about you. i know that, i really do. that — is not the issue. but there are plenty of others that i will work to start addressing now. tomorrow, and everyday after that. . (i need to put way more thought into this, still thinking. but i’m going to share what i’ve written with you…). . —. i’m gonna stop and writing: think about what you’ve been feeling. how i’ve made you feel worse. i feel sick, i feel guilty, but i want to imagine, as vividly as i can, how you are feeling. . . . —. . cross it out . you selfish. cross it you yea selfish. cross it out . you selfish bitch. selfish . . . </en-note>]]></content><created>20180821T033849Z</created><updated>20190505T194425Z</updated><note-attributes><author>omarwnema@gmail.com</author><source>desktop.mac</source><reminder-order>0</reminder-order></note-attributes></note>

style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">now, feeling a creative energy</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">throughout day, feeling slightly sad, distracted at thought of alisse wanting to break up</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">the worst parts: regret about how i acted saturday</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">but now: i feel calm. collected. motivated.</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">may making me feel less bad about sat night. not all me. like: she could have tried more to listen to me. and i did feel abused. the right thing to do, would have been to leave it all behind. and bring it up at a time when we’re not so exhausted.</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">learning about myself:</span>. <ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">i am extremely conciliatory</span></li></ul><br clear="none" />. . <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">how alisse feels.</span>. <br

be rational but small spouts of anxiety here and there</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">thinking a lot (particularly after talking to may) about how i need to assert myself more. how absence of that has hurt me. made it hard for her to see my viewpoint. given her a lot of power.</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">how: this is normal relationship stuff. transitions. kind of extreme. but like, shouldn’t give on it.</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">how: i have made progress. she’s judging progress arbitrarily.</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">the concept of ‘work’. putting in ‘work’. maybe obsessing over that too much, i think her thinking of stress.</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">optimism and how we love each other and be together and the stress will logically be less once we clarity.</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">what started this</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">how this process has revealed a lot of our tendencies</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">from me: you need better emotional support. respect for your space. trust in your love. withhold sadness when trying to communicate emotions?</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">if we break it down this way we can determine is it worth it?</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">from you: i need expectations (how frequently to talk etc, what it will be like when i visit you). i need to feel included in your med school life. to be open with me. to be a bit more forward when expressing when emotions. </span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">what makes me confident: we have had very few conversations about this</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">intuitively i think - i would so down to do those things for you and to commit to being better at that. </span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">--</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">why do you feel accused?</span>. <br clear="none" />. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">full history:</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">should i revisit last week? maybe? went like —</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">friday some nice texts but no i love you (as i get delayed, calling me bibi baby etc, relaying my flight patterns to everyone). </span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">saturday angry with me upon arrival. some tender hugs &amp; sex. hike (talking about me and my ambitions and that’s nice). then beach. phoebe’s later, home, feeling distant. </span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">sunday: i think..working for some of day. venice/ice cream at night. hanging is okay but don’t feel loved.</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">monday or tues: me crying at night. her mean, unsympathetic.</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">tues: going into day like maybe i should end this. coming back from class, sushi dinner. alisse excited about classwork. going on run. leaving, coming back (while i am cooking) and all of a sudden: affectionate. hugging me tightly before bed.</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">wednesday i think dinner. her at class mostly, and then making dinner. positive during the day, except when mentioning the talk and her getting ‘stressed out’. waiting to talk. crying. alisse slightly more sympathetic and seeing that i do indeed love her.</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">thursday — during the day, walking with tanya. going crazy, conversations with alisse out loud. crying in car. so much pain. me, more calm eventually. dinner just me and her: either cooking or going out. a talk eventually at night. her like: you fix this. kind of saying that she’ll help out a little (‘be available for questions’). that’s all i asked for. and then hooking up.</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">friday: relatively nice during day. morning, nice. doing things, cooking. and then feeling a flip when i get flowers. like just a light kiss. and during dinner her super distant / not introducing me to anyone. and then: the fight. sleeping at tanya’s.</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">saturday: crazy turbulent during the day. then nice conversation. alisse finally saying ‘i love you’ on her own. really nice time at the getty. fight at night tho.</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">sunday: okay mood. both of us exhausted. rational conversation at the end, and — a break.</span>. <br clear="none" />. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">talk on saturday. </span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">&gt; why didn’t i come back after she kicked me out?</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">&gt; </span>. <br clear="none" />. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">other thoughts -</span>. <span style="font-family:

<br clear="none" />. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">i tell myself: write, pour your thoughts, empty them, then you can go on a walk</span>. <br clear="none" />. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">thinking today about. well i don’t know if thinking critically so much as continuing to have imaginary conversations. not sure really any new revelations since yesterday. last night: reading alisses’ cards and like damn she really loves me. scouring for the birthday card but can’t find. found the other two from past month: lil card from seattle (‘i am filled with joy when i think about us’) and cute cute card when i had my day off (‘you are so smart and strong and don’t let these weirdos get in your way’). like damn i love that girl.</span>. <br clear="none" />. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">thinking about: like long-term things. and the fact that even if we wanna work this out. i have to move soon.</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">some sadness realizing that alisse may just not want to continue</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">and.. idk walk time</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">that i actually was making progress in supporting her and she wasn’t seeing it (**)</span>. <br clear="none" />. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">deciding: lift, get muscles now.</span>. <br clear="none" />. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">short hair, don’t like my face</span>. <br clear="none" />. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">9/20</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">--</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">i imagine now and like yea maybe she’ll want to work things out. but moving out etc. i don’t know. maybe it’s not the right time. maybe this won’t be a fulfilling relationship. i don’t need the time but i need the love. </span>. <br clear="none" />. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">stopping by work drink thing hi bye </span>. <br clear="none" />. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">dinner w trisha, friend from wesleyan (rachel) and her coworker. she okay honestly. categorized/judged by me as new england white girl. her story of transferring from connecticut college, in detail. trisha's relationship issues. nice to have company but really not feeling the veggie galaxy / diner vibe. and this feeling building up of: these are not my people. how, that wesleyan crew i'm down for when alisse is around. see the best in them. and now like eh these aren't my people. i mean trisha a homie but i don't know.</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">meeting w casey and delphine at liquor store. back to my house, drinking bottle of wine. baby joint. talking about. things. tesla and being a factory worker there. factory talk. apple too. and foxcon, this enormous factory complex that hires seasonal workers for different tech companies. how phones are assembled manually largely. power structures n things. casey's new pickup truck and california.</span>. <br clear="none" />. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">9/21 (writing 9/22)</span>. <br clear="none" />. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">work from home. because sleeping late, waking late. cm issue meeting and my patience wearing thin. screenshare with joe previous day and...patience wearing thin. channeling: overall frustration, but also recent realization that i do not like conflict, that i compromise -- and combating with assertion. it feels. bad. maybe. being less open. and this is a good trait. but when conversation gets circular. when i have listened to other person and they have not listened to me -- and when, i am the decision maker, i need to override. end. move on. with joe: this is circular. we are going for a certain ui quality. period. implement it how you want. so much complaining about how hard these styles are to re-use. you can make reuable components man. i don't know. understand that here are constraints and that we are working within them.</span>. <br clear="none" />. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">taking nap and deciding: no more work. balling but too windy. and me a little too stiff from lifting. so then off to gym. giving casey car keys.</span>. <br clear="none" />. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">then bbq at night. usual wholesome crew: jackie, brant, aaron, jacob, graham, two other engineers, casey + delph, harvard grad (destiny, sahar, bryan, other british guy). overall, a comforting night with 'deep' (maybe too many) conversations. kind of chilling small talking. jackie walks in and asks how i've been. delving into relationship issues. jackie talking about what she's learned about attachment styles. doesn't really apply to alisse. i mean: the way she wanted me to show her grand love does. but the overall tendencies of her in the past (to trust me, not need reassurance) does not follow. she does not have attachment issues really. describing then: how she's treated me. jackie totally with me on how painful that is. and how weird it is that nothing like this has ever happened. but also understanding how alisse was upset. anyway blah blah the only thing that does add up really as causes for fueling this fire are </span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">1) her not being able to take criticism </span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">2) being tired at reassuring me </span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">3) me not standing up for myself / her not seeing progress i've made </span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">4) me not standing up for myself / her seeing my need for reassurance as petty and taking up more space and</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">5) more ambiguous: something else going on w her. maybe: wanting to explore being bi (maybe not?). maybe: </span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">--</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">6) her not seeing my viewpoint / not letting me express that</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">7) her not expressing her viewpoint (because stress stress stress).</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">--</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">okay let's abstract this. from the causes to the patterns. one level less deep.</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">1) alisse not seeing my viewpoint</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">2) alisse not expressing herself</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">3) me continuing to fuck up..</span>. <br clear="none" />. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">talking to jackie also about religion. how losing it makes her feel a sense of emptiness. and to others who grew up non religiously as to whether it is easier to make meaning (since not losing something). me ending (mentally) with conflusion that: yes, if you abandon everything religion gave you then you will be truly lost. but not all of it is bad. take it as a starting point for developing your own framework.</span>. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">other questions: what makes you feel manly (from destiny). how often do you shave your balls. things things things. how do people interact and socialize and where i fit in the world and things i am thinking, thinking aobut..</span>. <br clear="none" />. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">9/22</span>. <br clear="none" />. <span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">writing retro now. at

(optimism). now with project. imagining also drawing classes. . thinking of telling alisse i wish she was here now on the floor with me listening to grouper. thinking: take snap. # of selfie takes before sending = clear, concrete proof insecurity i think. . i guess not so lonely lately somehow. . . suddenly emotional when listening to grouper. that sort of broad thinking mood. where anything becomes interesting. like recite a fact to myself about my occupation / lifestyle / status and the thought comes from the top layer — as a fact — and makes its way down slowly to next layer: what the fact means — and then down to me, slowly connecting to me. and this is powerful. like this very obvious fact is now powerful. my age. what i did today. what i ate. whatever. it’s fascinating. . hm fight mood or go with mood. now, scattered, spilling css classes all over the place. go with mood. . . now when writing tagging thoughts. . things to share for therapy. . siavash: ‘reef taught me how to be comfortable with silence’. . thinking of this thought parser description. . today things like. <ul><li><font style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Consolas;">wake up late (8am) and off to work</span></font></li><li><font style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Consolas;">work is work is good and stuff but still work and feels like work and not life lately.</span></font></li><li><font style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Consolas;">back home by 5pm. </span></font></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">workout. something lifty (prob should have done yoga)</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">shower, heat up food. order things online.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">work on project</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">lay down. lost in grouper.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">this is: the routine lately. lately being past two days but feeling longer. something similar last week, but up earlier.</span></li></ul>. . unexpected perk of therapy: now, instead of talking to imaginary cute girls about my emotional problems (feeding ego), having imaginary conversations with therapist instead. . . 11/2. . write that shit in your journal you fucking good boy. . 11/4. . how do i feel about all caps in design?

<note><title>2018-11-21</title><content><![CDATA[<en-note>----. . pitt. pitt. questioning whether alisse would sacrifice for me. has she had an opportunity to? or has she, and i haven’t noticed. &gt; i guess beach house concert . . imagining move to another place. frequently. working remotely for arcadia. . plotting out work now vs read vs wake early n work vs work extra early and yoga before work. . these things. . glass of wine and woozy but happy and feeling music and sensations and body. do cardio more endorphins are amazing. . guilt over forgetting to go w morgan to lunch. . in pitt now. long day. 4am wake up. 2:30 heavy heavy crash but maybe unhealthy lunch n sugar. maybe i need to sleep less because work is intense. . positive alisse things:. - i love you. nice long facetime saturday . . negative:. - imagining two months away. will you be okay?  - jealousy of other couples like kat and corbyn (per insta) who skype daily . - why doesn’t she miss me more?  - thanksgiving . - not getting text for few hours . . convo w lauren about nicks process. . do you feel obligated to order what waiter rec. . ***the incentives ****. . . agreeing with chachi -- this is not about ego. in the car. both -- drunk. time ticking. zoned focus. . 11-16. ---. plane to la. . wednesday night. missing alisse. also: drunk. and negative thoughts brewing (now, switching from podcast to diiv. continue) like: when has alisse sacrificed for me? the thought circulating many times, no answer, deep reflection just a mounting resentment. and then thinking: beach house concert. okay. maybe there are others. maybe she hasn't had the opportunity. i don't know. open. ask about it. i've done my due diligence in decentralizing support system. a non drunk me would have said. but i guess: more communication i think would be better. a month is my threshold, and i start to feel a bit more detached. well this plus: working on work, and not my own projects. anyway. being civil and good boy who goes to therapy, translating this blob of negativity -- or maybe, pulling apart one element of it -- and saying 'i miss you'. maybe some truth. . wed morning. at coffee shop. crazy mocha. expecting hip, but not hip. and so working, adjusting to drab vibe. and waiter recommending i get a danish. and: clearly not wanting a danish, i just get it. because i asked what she recommended. i guess indecisive. but i knew i did not want that. . wednesday night, earlier. out after design day. . this idea brewing of more writing/digital art. or tools for writers to make writing more visual. these things. . tuesday night. after design day with joe. leaving in the afternoon, crashing for a bit. more work. and then: a run. feeling *great*. to hotel bar for dinner. glass of wine. glass of wine enough to make me feel tipsy. salmon. and the jolly business man next to me, working on crash investigations (uber automated cars) for the government. off he goes, downstairs, for another beer. i read a little. a little more. tired but awake at night. the same thoughts as wednesday night. clarity in above description = mostly me repeating the more sober thoughts. . i guess work and emails and product management is not super fulfilling. but i do want to create beautiful things. . lately: afternoon crashes. maybe, go back to salads, morning gym, and later coffee start. . lingering night conversations, work related. monday, (with lauren, dropping me off to honda dealer): nick's process. how he's expecting to constantly trim engineering estimates. . chachi i guess getting the full engineering goss and hearing how josh was an asshole to me. i really didn't take it that way. good at taking crticism (in work setting) -- to the point of obliviousness? or maybe not good at taking criticism but moreso seeing positivity in others' intentions. but actually he was kind of a process nut and overly strict and kind of a dick maybe now that i think of it. and did tell nick of things directly. but also seemed to be nice to me in a genuine way. i don't know. . chachi and greg friends and know each other and each others' wives and all that but also seems like chachi has no respect for him as director. and like neither do others at rivers. . sort of disappointed when hearing that, in middle of speech about we need proper structure (near mini fireplace outside meadery) talking about how we could use a ux designer and i'm like bitch i am the designer i can design i can do it all i am the full package. desperately wanting people to call my design dazzling and beautiful. but i guess getting that from stw team, user research, seeing how the product is holding up well. . okay wait remembering this bit chachi and kim were talking about how they were like unsure about me and then kim is like 'i had the same realization' and something along the lines of how i'm a good guy or something. . okay that conversation with chachi tuesday night. both of us drunk. him driving. one noticeable swerve. why did i get in the car with him? i mean, can recall previous night quite clearly. but: pulling up near the hotel. at a major intersection. emergency lights on. and telling me about his philosophy and how he wants to make referral the model project and he's open to criticism and like yo just tell me what you're thinking and call me out and i'm really not trying to be a dick and this is not about ego. variants of this. sequence of drinks. at meadery. spiced wine. pretty good. then 131, upscale cocktail place with no vibes. there: hearing of hra deadline, burnout. and like framing my product-centric context. these engineers need a bonus or something. need to be better respected. how narrow nick's view is. how he made himself to be a vp but is sort of reckless.i mean in a subtle way. not wanting to be a leader. a purveyor of structure. but that's what he's supposed to be doing. late at night: talking about women in engineering. kim mainly. and shocking how few women developers have interacted with. i mean this whole visit interesting like being in this developer world. this new world. 3 days in the world though, too much. dragging me down. patience wearing down. wanting to escape. . jon's perception of me. how i could have given a better impression in pitt. come in with a presence. but like. fleeting thought. i mean, letting thought flee because not caring enough. . wednesday, thursday pushing the team to 'think abstractly'. breaking apart each action and whether it can be abstracted. feeling smart for this. and: really form/details easily abstracted. actions not really. we already have status change listener that writes to activtiy log and that seems good enough. . wed late night / thurs morning. waking at 2am, vomiting and desperately trying to clear myself (a first, shameful way to end my streak), clean mouth of taste. but waking at 5:30, no hangover, and suprisingly productive. workout. to einstein bros. the same clouds from yesterday there. a 'healthy' bagel. off to work to kick things off. team not energized the way i want. and like is the form of thinking i'm leading to the right one? i think it is. but not taking enough command &amp; charge. and really they're being rude and a little unprofessional. . pittsburgh, so damn cloudy. . thursday delight: lunch with coco. his mama asking all about me and plans. hearing about the chem demo colin flew in for. curtis and gf recent move to portland. . today: vietnamese coffee shop. getting a coffee, and later a chai latte. and thinking how i used to really juddge siavash for getting two espressos in one session at nine bar -- or maybe it was a matcha and an espresso - and now my restrctions on consumption so much lower. check yourself. . okay switch and think about. now here la: alisse. this potluck. and alisse. and hearts. . 11-21. --. writing 4 therapy. recurring patterns of: balding (why even?). alisse not making me feel welcome fri night during potluck. and jealousy in diff ways. and that i have to be happy otherwise alisse has little tolerance for me. like: in the past, working through my issues. and now it seems deciding that my issues are prob not worth her time. floating over and over thinking of this. . but i think something clear i can actually speak to alisse about:. <ul><li>happy to be around your family</li><li>*not sure how i fit into your med school life*. it was important to me to feel welcome around your friends and i still don't feel that. do you talk about me with friends, etc? that it felt like i was reluctantly introduced as your bf.</li><li>that you've never mentioned that you want me to move here. that me moving involves planning and thinking of this, and in a weird place</li></ul>. la so far. <ul><li>fri: potluck. </li><li>sat: vegas in morning. drive drive. at resort. alisse &amp; lisa offroad. rest of us: groceries. cook dinner, chill, sleep.</li><li>sun. zion. night: i would like you to do more to show appreciation to my parents.</li><li>mon: bryce.</li><li>tues: zion: angel's landing. driving, night in vegas. a small outing: to fountains, and for boba. me, lisa, raccine.</li><li>wed: back to huntington.</li><li>thurs: thanksgiving. night: watching insecure.</li><li>fri: wake and ?</li><li>sat:</li></ul>. 11-24. . last night, bringing up the move to LA / wanting to hear thoughts. can we talk about this later? when later? i don't know. looking sad but. . the three points keeping me up at night. actually the full imagined convo here. <ul><li>centered around me. i want to move, soon. three places in mind: nyc, oakland, la. oakland + la = in state tuition and warmth. nyc + oakland = good support system. la = you. </li><li>bad things</li><ul><li>i don't feel like i can be vulnerable around you lately. feeling judgment rather than sympathy.</li><li>i don't feel welcomed into med school life (recalling friday mainly)</li><li>i haven't heard any excitement about moving here. it's all been driven by me.</li></ul><li>good things</li><ul><li> you've supported very well in the past. </li><li>you welcomed me into your family for the past week. </li><li>we really love each other and have a special relationship that i know i can't have with anyone else.</li></ul><li>if no response. would you care if i move to NYC? do you really want me in LA noting that there is some level of obligation.</li></ul>. 11-29. --. okay. so like recalling that list above - the 3 bad things over and over in mind - circulating further in brain, when, end of night, i ask alisse: 'can you let me know what thoughts are on moving?'. and her undecided. and me - honestly -- also probably undecided. like partly because questioning alisse's commitment. but. then i think about explaining that i'm in california to mama and baba. and the real barriers to being together long-term. and my weird dream of being with someone maybe more like me. like more spunky. or creative or something. and i combine these things and like 'really am i ready to move'. but wanting to hear from alisse 'baby i want you i want you' something like that. . and - night before leaving. not having sex. i guess having to wake up early and sleepy and stuff. and then also next day afternoon, before leaving, not ready to bang. except we did right before leaving. after talking about moving and stuff. alisse like ‘i definitely wanna be with you for the next year’. and saying. (i think commitment turns alisse on. at least commitment from me? or is it just her ego.). . 11-30. —. up after smoking and stuff last night and like ugh i really regret but no just pretending to really regret it because somehow i feel fine. as always, tempted to chill when teresa is around. i think maybe not an attraction and i think maybe just loving her aura and how i feel around the group of people. idk. anyway. last night meet up at cuchi cuchi. the tables with patterns. debate of: does it respond to touch. conclusion: yes, see sensors. brendan, teresa, trisha, betty. betty a badass cosmopolitan always hopping on flights. and like thinking of her and her existence and how she might have grown up to be such a confident and badass woman. don’t know her at all really. talking of: her trip mexico. brendan and crazy story doing door-to-door sales — solicited for sex once, another time — man abruptly asked if he wanted blowjob (realizing might be paying for underage sex, as he noticed teenager leaving before). hm pretty good laughter n times. t-wu parking car at my house. me having to pee but then chill session organically emerging in the dunge. roll one up — wait no one is already rolled — bring out the mini ice cream cones. talking i think about our upbringings / how teresa’s parents gave them lots of freedom and didn’t try to push them too hard in one direction. other things like: err i don’t remember. . . before bed looking at mirror and body and i like and then — high so positive mood — taking selfies — but also carrying the criticality of (my face) earlier — and kind of feeling ambivalent about face like i guess i can see how someone else likes it but me not so much. . eating not one but two mini ice cream cones last night. . lately taking face/look anxieties a little far. thinking like of what i actually look like. what i truly look like. picking apart face shapes. ‘but how can i like myself if i don’t like myself?’. a: i don’t think i can?  . earlier drive back from work — late night, style guide / design meeting with nick at work — thinking about how i did not prepare that hard. and the earlier me who would have hustled so hard at this opportunity. a lunch with amrit. always loving honesty. a real person. lingering question = how do i ask to work remotely? . . 12-1. —. now, new kaytranada album. pop not the right texture maybe for writing. but like. fuck throw something on. stuck in my head. restless, mind running fast. unable to focus. starting to feel myself but like jerked off twice already today. too much screen. finishing swing time. the ending not really resonating. just kind of flat end. need to re-read / think about it. . the tendency to want to look at a review. to read about other’s thoughts prior to processing on your own. . things i need to do: meet up w a student from ucsb, meet up ucla. get on that media arts literature. browsing the ucla dma student profiles like wha wha wha some made music videos for ash koosha and like so many features on news and stuff. a couple of seemingly normal creative people who worked creative corporate jobs. . at forge today. getting there near 2. a chai latte. packed. a conversation near me: phd, part-time working cs guy (machine learning stuff), prob harvard, fresh out of 5 year relationship but not showing clear signs of vulnerability and weakness, and more quiet / nice woman who isn’t looking to offend anyone. the tone of people who know of each other — same circle — but maybe not super intimate / good friends on their own. . getting to reef’s at 10. drinks and work, the intention, but drinks and talking the reality. reef tho, as usual, not restless. taking his time to pour the drinks (like a good 20 min in). and sipping so slowly. tangentially: how he doesn’t have current romantic prospect (for long time) but is totally good. i think, confident, loves himself in a super healthy and somehow humble way. . okay the latest in thoughts on face. a thought stream for - about a year - in depth now. like a known and identified thought stream. and little progress. yes my face is long this is a fact. looking at pretty ucla dma candidate with clearly long face based on skeletal scan (project in which she printed her skull, had it recite things) — and she is beautiful. and then taking a quick selfie. face i think looks okay. it’s not great but okay is def good enough because there are other things to love. i just need a lovable face. now, revisiting photo booth video of me in bk that summer, making video for maliha’s bday. . thinking about maliha today. . thinking about explaining my friendship with maliha to others. having this imaginary conversation with people who are maybe interested in my past about how like ‘no i wasn’t exactly a bro my best friend was a girl’ and i guess stroking ego through this perpetuation of subversive image even when skewed closer to the bro mainstream. imagining her dying this is not not good. . earl album just a stream and riding it thank you for inviting me into your brain.
