                As part of my internship with Charles River Analytics, I worked on SONNET - a project that attempts to merge narrative research in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and marketing in order to create useful predictions and suggestions for writers. I was asked to develop a framework for quantifying narrative attributes. Collaboration with Benjamin Bauchwitz (MIT '15). This project was my first foray into coding.

        <p> SONNET, or Studies to Operationalize Neuro-Narratology for Effective Tools - is a ($7M) government-funded research project that aims to sense and forecast listenersâ€™ reactions to stories. 
        <br /><br /> At the time that I had joined Charles River Analytics (CRA) for my summer internship, this project (which the firm had contracted) was still in a conceptual phase. Before developing a fully-fleshed product, CRA needed to compile narrative research, and determine a standard format for quantifying findings from narrative research studies.

        Use cases - the intended users for SONNET are marketers, or people crafting communication/campaign tools.  CRA had envisioned a tool that curates writing content for users based on desired emotional response. By drawing on a database of quantified narrative research, the tool can also translate physiological measurements to emotional responses. Writers can therefore fine-tune stories to achieve an intended emotional response.
        <span class="info-tooltip">
        <br /> Narratives here are not limited to a particular format or medium.<br />More about the desire to quantify narratives: rather than relying on subjective surveys to gauge emotional responses to a narrative - CRA wanted to move towards a deeper, more visceral (or at least, more physiological/physical) understanding of narrative responses. 
        <br />
        As a reductive example: <br />
        A writer looking to induce, say, suspense in their audience, may receive a suggestion to include a certain type of character revelation. After crafting this narrative with a writing suggestion, and testing it on a sample audience, users will go on to test the narrative on a small sample audience (using inexpensive, commerically-available physiological sensors). Test results are inputted into SONNET, which will reveal the induced emotional response. User can continue to write / test until the desired response is acheived.
        <br /><br />
        Of course, these are lofty, long-terms goals - a substantial amount of machine learning (and user input) is needed to actually achieve a narrative development tool.

        <p> My role - was to delve into narrative research literature, <span class="highlight-grey">compile studies, and summarize them in a way that can be quantified for use in SONNET</span>.<br /> As the internship progressed, I wanted move beyond synthesizing studies - and actually interact with an end product. Though I had no coding skills going into the internship, my supervisor (David Koelle) agreed to let me move beyond simply summarizing narratives, and translate <span class="highlight-grey">some of my findings into data structures</span>. I collaborated with Benjamin Bauchwitz (MIT '15), another intern, to create a text parser (in Java) that extracts quantitative narrative relationships from semi-natural input text.

        + I started the research process by first understanding the power of narrative - and attempting to confirm a finding that was implicit in the creation of this project: narratives are powerful tools for eliciting behavioral change.

            + In the next phase of my research, I conducted a <span class="highlight-grey">broad survey of narrative research</span>. I picked apart aspects of narratives have been studied in different academic disciplines, and tried to add up a 'complete' picture of narrative research. 
            <span class="info-tooltip">      
            Narratives are inherently multi-disciplinary, and few research studies, I found, focused on the content of a narrative while still measuring psychological responses in a quantifiable way. <br />
            Generally, marketing studies would focus only on the aspect of persuasion - and used surveys to measure whether beliefs were changed. Psychology studies were primarily interested in audience engagement and persuasion. Cognitive science studies, in the same vein, focused on engagement and persuasion, but often did not go into fine details on the content of a narrative. These studies did however, offer heavily quantified results - in the form of surveys, brain scans, and physiological measurements.

        <p>Synthesizing research - conducting a broad review showed that narrative research could be synthesized to yield a quantified framework for gauging user responses. 
        <br />
        <span class="info-tooltip">
        (Granular writing suggestions however, would have to be left to user input and machine learning - there were simply not enough studies that focused on specific aspects of narrative writing that yield responses).         
        In order to synthesize narrative research, I standardized jargon and concepts used in different fields. The concept of 'flow' in psychology, for example, is closely related to 'narrative transportation' cited in marketing studies.

        <p> After aggregating research, I developed a standard, data structure-compatible format for summarizing research findings. The text parser I developed with Ben Bauchwiz scans the 'components' and 'context' sections, and picks up three-part relationships (element -&gt; relationship -&gt; element). As elements are joined on common relationships, a larger database of research is developed. Notice that each relationship is assigned context objects, which serve as the basis for extrapolating different relationships and applying findings to new narratives.
        <span class="info-tooltip">
        <br />
        We worked to ensure that our input structure could be parsed reliably in Java, while still being human-readable. 
        <br />
        You'll notice that these research relationships are simply binary - and do not have a gradient or scale. I had started to prototype more sophisticated quantitative relationships (that take in p-values, or results of brain scan studies), but was unable to integrate this into my parser during the internship duration.
