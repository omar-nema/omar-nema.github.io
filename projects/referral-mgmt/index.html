            Referral networks are complex, unwieldy, and ripe for optimization. Because healthcare providers have limited visibility into referral options for their patients - they often refer
            And the adniminstrative burden
            Within large provider networks, thousands of patients are referred to specialists every day.


            The referral process is segmented across a number of tools: EMR, email, fax, CRM databases. Referral coordinators at the provider network scrap together these disparate data elements to shepherd referral cases through the approval process.
            Current referral processes carry a high administrative burden. The lack of integration and standardization prevents networks from tracking referral processes and developing strategies to drive referrals inside the network.
            Arcadiaâ€™s Referral Application aims to reduce administrative cost by consolidating referrals to specialists on a single integrated platform. We intend to drive greater activity in network through suggestive logic built into the platform. Our platform will also enable greater transparency in the referral process and allow networks to track performance and efficiency in the referral process.
            The tool, released in 2018 in co-development with a large provider client, is currently built for a centralized referral management team to support PCPs in referrals and expedite the approval process while focusing on keepage in-network. The tool is a referral suggestion and approval tool meant for internal organizational use between providers and a referral team. The Referral Application User Guide is included as Exhibit 1 to provide Cigna with details on the current capabilities and use cases for the Referral Management Application.

            With a team of engineers, I built and designed a product aimed at improving the referral process.

            American healthcare incentivizes procedures: sicker patient populations often result in higher revenue for hospitals. In my day job, I work with organizations that are shifting to <a href="https://www.nextstepsolutionsinc.com/what-is-value-based-healthcare/">value-based care models</a> that instead compensate for positive patient outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Value-based care necessitates holistic (addressing social needs) and preventive care. 'Care Management' programs are aimed at filling the gaps in care that a doctor does not typically provide: coordinating services, addressing social needs, and ensuring engagement with doctor recommendations. Typically, social workers and nurses work to fill these needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the past two years (2017 onwards), I have been leading product development for Arcadia's care management suite. <strong>The product enables clinicians to better address the social needs of patients, document, and communicate across disciplines. </strong> I designed the interface (UX, visual, and product), reporting model, and workflow automation engine. I've also managed its implementation - both externally with care teams, and internally with the engineers executing on development. The product continues to scale, and is now used by more eight large healthcare organizations (with patient populations that range from 100,000 to 1 million).
