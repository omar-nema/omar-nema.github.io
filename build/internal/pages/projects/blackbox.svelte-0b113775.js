Their recording is shared with a single stranger, and can be played just once. Directly afterward, they receive a recording from a different stranger.","Blackbox was built in React Native connected to an AWS RDS database."]]}class T extends i{constructor(t){super();c(this,t,w,y,l,{})}}export{T as default};
