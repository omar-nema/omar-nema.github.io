      Current treatment - Epidural Electrical Stimulation (EES) of the spinal cord has shown to improve motor control in humans and animals with spinal cord injury.<span class="info-tooltip">Zapping the spinal cord can actually induce controlled movement. Motor signals can be reduced to (convoluted) electrical pathways. Though our understanding of these pathways is rudimentary, neuro-engineers have been able to manipulate these pathways using neural implants and electrodes to produce constrained movement. </span>

      The end goal of EES research is to develop a closed-loop system where neural implants can translate intention to move -> electrical stimulation -> actual movement. Currently, neural implants do receive feedback from muscle and neural recordings - but these signals are only decoded with low fidelity. <span class="info-tooltip">A fully closed-loop system would necessitate having a thorough understanding of neural pathways to stimulate, as well as rigorous method of decoding thoughts. Brain control is a distant, but possible reality...</span>

      Creating a tool for EES simulation entails re-creating the spinal cord (physically and biologically) from scratch. As you might imagine, our end product does not come close in complexity to an actual primate spinal cord. It does however, provide a <span class="highlight-grey">functioning framework of an EES experiment</span>. Users can place an electrode in a physically-accurate spinal cord, run a simulation, and determine which motor fibers were recruited as a result of the virtual experiment.
      <br><br>
      We ensured that our computational model was <a href="https://github.com/penguinscontrol/Spinal-Cord-Modeling"  class="underline">well-documented</a> to allow for other researchers to use the model and build on it. As more EES experiments are conducted, our model will have more data to draw from, and become more accurate. Though the project is no longer in my hands, the Borton Lab has continued development

      We used three pieces of software to create a hybrid physical-neural model of the spinal cord.
      <span class="info-tooltip">
      Current software can be used to create physics simulations, or neural simulations, but not both. We used MATLAB to mediate between a finite element model (physical model) constructed on COMSOL, and a neural model created on NEURON software.

      We tested our model by running simulations, and, simply, doing the math. Each 3D spinal cord component to be imported into COMSOL, a physics simulator, as a volume conductor. Our electrode, approximated as a surface current source, was placed in the epidural space to imitate EES experiments. (Later on, electrode placement was reduced to a simple parameter in MATLAB, allowing for quicker iteration in determining electrode placement).

Given that current and conductivity (equation 1) are constant, distance from the source is responsible for the relationship shown. At the top center of the graph (dark area), the distance to the point source is lowest, and voltage is at a maximum). Anatomically, we see the same patterns that were demonstrated in real experiments: the highest concentration of current in the epidural space, with a large voltage drop-off in the CSF, and some current carried over into the dura.</span>

         Threshold, depolarization, repolarization, and refractory period phases are clearly shown. The motor neuron, pictured in orange, is recruited after the Ia fiber, which is expected given that the motor neuron is stimulated indirectly.

      <p>Model structure - <br>Using MATLAB, we integrated our physical (finite element) and neural models. At the user level,  MATLAB code carries biophysical and electrical parameters of stimulation, relevant plots, and debugging tools.

      We wrote a MATLAB script to generate geometric points representing fibers in the spinal cord. This geometric axon was transposed onto the Finite Element model, where voltage values along nodes of the axon (corresponding to points along internode intervals) are written to a text file. COMSOL-generated voltage values, along with electrical and biophysical parameters, are fed to NEURON (through the command line, and text files), where a biophysical simulation is run using realistic electrical values. Results from the NEURON simulation are written to a text file, which serve as the basis for a MATLAB plot of the recruitment curve.

      <p>Validation - our computational model (like those in research literature) was built under the assumption that the number of motor axons recruited is proportional to a motor potential produced by an EES stimulus [Capogrosso]. This assumption entails that the recruitment curve â€“ a plot of neuron firing as a result of stimulation â€“ is a valid metric for evaluating model efficacy.

      The recruitment curve below shows the same sigmoidal shape that is described in literature studies using the same diameter distribution. <span class="info-tooltip">The graph below reveals typical characteristics of a recruitment curve that Capogrosso and Vleggert-Lankamp describe [PAPER]. The slope of this sigmoid shape is a result of our diameter distribution â€” larger diameter fibers are the first to be recruited, and smaller fibers are gradually recruited afterwards. We also see a flat-line preceding a certain threshold voltage, a positive slope where fibers start to reach threshold and elicit action potentials, and a peak value where all fibers are recruited.
