title: thesis
time: 2014-2015
heading: A collaboration with Radu Darie in the Borton Neuromotion Laboratory at Brown University. We created a tool to predict movement from spinal cord stimulation in primates. The project was thoroughly documented to allow for continuous development, and the Borton laboratory has continued to  build on the project.

        <p>Work to address motor deficit, the end goal - neuro-engineers are working to bypass the brain's motor circuits in people with motor deficits. The end goal is to create a closed-loop system where neural implants act to decode intention to move. This signal would then translated to a corresponding electrical stimulation that produces the desired movement.
