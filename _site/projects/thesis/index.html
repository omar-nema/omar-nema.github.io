The project was built in modular fashion to allow for continuous development, and the Borton laboratory has continued to build on the project.

        Creating a tool for EES simulation entails re-creating the spinal cord (physically and biologically) from scratch. As you might imagine, our end product does not come close in complexity to an actual primate spinal cord. It does however, provide a <span class="highlight-grey">functioning framework of an EES experiment</span>. Users can place an electrode in a physically-accurate spinal cord, run a simulation, and determine which motor fibers were recruited as a result of the virtual experiment.
        <br /><br />
        We ensured that our computational model was <a href="https://github.com/penguinscontrol/Spinal-Cord-Modeling" class="underline">well-documented</a> to allow for other researchers to use the model and build on it. As more EES experiments are conducted, our model will have more data to draw from, and become more accurate. Though the project is no longer in my hands, the Borton Lab has continued development

        Current software can be used to create physics simulations, or neural simulations, but not both. We used MATLAB to mediate between a finite element model (physical model) constructed on COMSOL, and a neural model created on NEURON software.

        <p>Model structure - <br />Using MATLAB, we integrated our physical (finite element) and neural models. At the user level,  MATLAB code carries biophysical and electrical parameters of stimulation, relevant plots, and debugging tools. Running a simulation with our model demands that the user interacts with MATLAB (as MATLAB probes COMSOL and NEURON for values).

        We wrote a MATLAB script to generate geometric points representing fibers in the spinal cord. This geometric axon was transposed onto the Finite Element model, where voltage values along nodes of the axon (corresponding to points along internode intervals) are written to a text file. COMSOL-generated voltage values, along with electrical and biophysical parameters, are fed to NEURON (through the command line, and text files), where a biophysical simulation is run using realistic electrical values. Results from the NEURON simulation are written to a text file, which serve as the basis for a MATLAB plot of the recruitment curve.

        <p>Validation - our computational model (like those in research literature) was built under the assumption that the number of motor axons recruited is proportional to a motor potential produced by an EES stimulus [Capogrosso]. This assumption entails that the recruitment curve – a plot of neuron firing as a result of stimulation – is a valid metric for evaluating model efficacy.

The slope of this sigmoid shape is a result of our diameter distribution — larger diameter fibers are the first to be recruited, and smaller fibers are gradually recruited afterwards. We also see a flat-line preceding a certain threshold voltage, a positive slope where fibers start to reach threshold and elicit action potentials, and a peak value where all fibers are recruited.
