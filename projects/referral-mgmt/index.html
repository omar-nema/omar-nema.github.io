          Referral networks - like the one I visualized below - are complex, and ripe for optimization. Similar to social communities, referral networks tend to cluster in groups. Referral circles build around social relationships between providers.
          <span class="info-tooltip">
          These known specialists may not be the best option for the patient. Provider ratings, availability, and patient preferences are not always weighed in the process of choosing a specialist. Less costly, or more effective providers are often underlooked. To add to this, the process of referral submission and approval is convoluted - resulting in a high processing time.

          I collaborated with a development team at Arcadia.io to build <strong>a web application that empowers providers to find high-quality, in-network providers for patients</strong>. My role spanned research, product design (UX/UI/user research), internal product management, and external product implementation.

              <p>
               In redesigning the referral process and building a new platform, my goal was to both reduce patient wait time for referrals, and improve the quality of provider selection on referrals.

                The application is built around three  clinician roles: the referring provider, referral manager, and medical director.

              <p>
                In the case of a behavioral health referral, the provider submits a referral request. The referral manager then contacts the patient, and works to understand their needs and preferences. The process ends when the patient is matched with a provider who they feel comfortable engaging with.

              <p>The process of finding a specialist starts with referral submission. Within the app, clinicians can submit behavioral health, or medical referrals. The submission is routed directly to a referral manager, who will work more closely with the patient to understand their needs.

              In the case of a Behavioral Health referral: the provider submits a form with identifying patient information. Insurance information is verified in order to determine if the patient can pay for the referral. Clinical information, and specialist preferences are added.

                After the referral is submitted - it will appear in an 'unassigned' referral manager queue. The referral manager will then reach out to the patient, and ask a templated set of questions to stratify their needs.

              <p class="mobile-hide">
                Some of these preferences (insurance type, gender preference, transportation needs, service needs) will automatically filter out suggested providers. Others will be listed on the case record for the provider and referral manager to reference.

                Finding a provider typically involves a few exchanges with the patient and provider. Referral managers will typically opt to bookmark a few providers, and gradually narrow down to a single provider based on  availability and fit.

          In additional to Behavioral Health referrals, providers can submit requests for procedural medical referrals. Medical referrals requests are automatically processed using a configured rules engine. These referrals are categorized as in network, out of network, or exceptions.
          </p>
          <p>
          Based on the resulting categorization, referrals will have different suggested actions. For example, an out of network referral will have a suggested action to escalate to a medical director for approval. The resulting workflow is seamless and efficient: in network cases are auto approved, and all other cases are routed to referral managers with a suggested action.
