1-10. plane to lisbon. right now you are (broad broad broad) 24 years old. sitting on dark plane, screen tilted, dimmed, writing. blasting kendrick and thinking of last summer. right now you are: 24.5 years old, living alone. your social life contained. a girlfriend - beautiful, grounded, smart. semi-fit. concerned with your appearance, the length of your face. friends are scattered, different, thoughtful, beautiful. style is better. you are a designer. a decent one, but not a great one. you are: somewhat talented at your job given the constraints (age , lack of experience). you are: feeling more close to family. you are: pierced, on both ears. you are: okay with your body, mostly. you are: thinking of aging. you are: less afraid of self-categorization. less afraid of you. first hour, drifting drifting, tim hecker, drifting into sleep. next 30 - rereading neuromancer (because, forgetting since it has taken me too long). much more enjoyable on reread. the environment making sense. 2 glasses of wine. awake despite no coffee. well 2 matcha. matcha, today, at nine bar. prior to trip, looking up: spain. things to do. neighborhoods. alternative things. things. lady clumsily bumping into headphone while walking by. and then noticing:: she has neck brace. the nth lesson in withhold judgment. now - damn, kendrick playing. last summer flooding in memory. listening to damn on headphones near charles / mgh station. 'fear' playing. windy. not recalling hanging out, laughing, or any sort of concrete action. just the mental state i was in while listening. not easily described with words at my disposal. something like: living, carefree, grounded. energy is outward. feeling environment, absorbing taking engaging. energy spilling. less controlled. take it. you, have it. i don't care. take it. other songs in album evoking this same feeling, though with less clarity. and now, energy limited, contained. deliberate. an entity that requires thought to release. comes out on its own, but only when many factors constructively interering. on the airplane, time feeling slower, beats slower, linger. the background in 'element'. the bass dropping slower. can pull it all apart. 'humble'. coming out before summer. but seeing the video. and feeling that mmph. 3x plays, bopping, ugh ugh. 'loyalty'. outside at some park. mystic park or something. with: eric, ahmed, siavash, arash. bumping out of the bluetooth speakers. smoking elevated, near the rocks. watching the kids. mush of conversation - easy, heartfelt - as i'm jamming. 'love'. simple and catchy, but from kendrick. questioning the indie in me. 'blood'. high, in my room, with arash, adam, siavash. blasting blasting the album for the first time. others drifting into sleep. cut to: describing album release party to alisse. alisse: is an observer. alisse: i'm okay with your mood swings. just how you express your emotions. think she means it. be honest with yourself. a sudden bout of - reflection - lately. spill ooze ooze. brain__spill. in logan. eating at generic healthy fast food place. as if mottos were generalized, copied from something, somewhere. and seeing that all workers there are 3arab. receiving the 'chicken chopstick bowl' (no chopsticks included, or available). mishearing the hijabi handing food to me. and self-conscious, the 'am i real arab' thoughts surfacing. coupled with: a thank you / shukran mumble. knowing your limitations: is what is needed for success really. because: world is replete with resources (to learn or do). i just need to know what i need. i need to know what i'm poorly. the thought prompted by early days as designer. got a lot of direction from nick. saying something like 'having trouble starting design language, plz help. back to the involution design sessions. how do our designs compare? what's thoughtful about theirs? how did they deal with care plan? i suppose the same as ours. care plans - biggest gap in new care mgmt features. needs to be: more condensed. task checklist will work maybe, if we make it easier to add new intervention. (just add the care plan restyle into 4.15, no approval needed). do what i need to make this good. add UX tickets. do it. be rogue. also: need a design sprint between 4.16 and 4.17. *link to care plan review, directly from care plan page. *link to portions of care plan review from care plan page. like 'add note to goal'. hm. *how can we actually train people to use this?  everybody (alisse especially) leaving boston prompting me to think of next step. next step. in my professional career. this is where i am. feeling super thankful for job this week. partly after going on / ranting about how i'm lucky to have it, saturday night at saloon with alisse. but also: imagine i didn't get this. where i would be. at a company. slowly climbing the ranks. maybe a newly crowned senior analyst. maybe back in school doing CS. or at an okay design school. all to prep to get to: where i am now. okay dangerous tendencies in relationship: . - always putting hanging with alisse over others. or: not fully committing to spreading out, getting into a chill session. lingering in the back of head: need to see alisse by end of night. - not spending as much time doing the tangible things that i have discernment in / use as means of self-gratification. design projects. - not writing. really: moving my vaidation from above to alisse. i suppose not terrible. like if we break up, a transition period where validation moves back to above? or maybe, entire self destroyed, dissolved. nick like 'i trust you..well, i trust you now' when it comes to design. agreeing. like damn i really sucked. and still not a 'good desgner'. just a decent one, that can make something intuitive. but not beautiful. pleasant. work on that work on that. nick: truly amazing at his job. but also: work and then sleep. how does he feel about this? what is his relationship with girlfriend like? does he talk of work developments?  bad work things. committing to loading goals, interventions, but erm not getting it done in time. and now leaving leaving. nick taking this well, on appearance. but me: not really apologizing. just like. no. this isn't gonna happen. not smiling at people. reaching out. asking about their days. being social. ambitions naturally change in winter, way more productive. it's true it's true. recalling all the shitty stories i wrote in 'fiction i'. how can i get to be a better fiction writer?  and: conversation with yahya day before yesterday. talking about: visa situation. yahya accepting that he will likely be immigrant for much of his life. asylum case in 1.5 years. yahya - always speaking at a broad / philosphical / reflective level. his progression with meditation. clarity. yahya's point that meditation brings you clarity, which grounds, you, makes you feel good. discussing a 'hypothetical' example - how do you deal with case in which you're unhappy about appearance? yahya echoing an idea that it's better to know that you're ugly? do i agree? the healthy, meditation-based process: okay, do looks prevent me from what i want to get? (success, girls, a: no?). do i actually look bad or is it just me? . spending 5 days in a row with alisse. all quite good. great sex the whole time. except last day. working, alisse keeping company. eating with her. not much to talk about but like relaxing and chilling and i think it's good? stretching, too. seeing how: good chilling isn't really sustainable though. spending more time will inevitably sacrifice the quality. what arises instead: a coexistence that can maybe be beautiful? or: you live together, but lead busy lives in which the respective selves of fulfilled irrespective of partner (douchey wording). these thoughts leading me into marriage? can i / one / mostly i have an _actively_ happy marriage. yes underscore = italics. feeling like i'm less idealistic. (don't say that, don't say that). getting ride with alisse to airport. a quickie, prior to leaving.

phrases. caught in the loop. escape the loop. my goal. my life is just wanting to escape the loop. like make a nice loop, and then escape it. or. parameterize. a loop with variables. opportunities to exist. re-enter. re-enter a slightly different loop . —. my loops are good. work, gym, friends etc. the underlying structure / what i miss as result is danger. we have to keep loops. so like above is the approach needed for fulfilling life. . — . podcast today about bubbles. getting caught in a bubble. guy in sf with prestigious job feeling trapped by his beautiful life. the structure of our lives determines who we are. a terrifying thought. for someone whose self worth is predicated on: turbulence, creativity, and originality. . my approach to exiting the bubble is..?  —. lately, hearing myself more often. this is a bad thing. — . same as lately, lately, checking myself in every mirror and combination / permutation of self. . like. seeking truth in aesthetics through exposure. . but maybe that’s not the right approach. getting nowhere. believing that others think i’m cute. but why. my face is long it’s still long. can we take the features and restructure? . but no a couple days this week sort of liking face. —. feeling less the tangibility of money. —. lately the glow of screen, the small red number with notifications - addictive. — . yesterday: presenting care management stuff to bidco. of course, not going to use most features in near future. but direction is right. affirming as designer. my innovation (though simple) - the care plan review form is what’s important. just need to ensure that design gaps are filled. . leaving. and seeing myself, from career perspective. getting ready (searching everywhere for wallet). and then a text from alisse like: can you figure out dates wanna book hawaii if necessary now. then: actually tentative plan is to be in hawaii can do something in between family trip. going off to get drinks for kelly evan’s goodbye, texts lightly lingering in my head. talking with uber driver about his career. machinist. now uber driver. immigrated age 10. 30 now. colombian. hard worker. at bar. texts lingering, anyway, but not too bothered. alisse still seems keen to travel, but has just booked lots. then: grasping that she is booked like end march on. and that she’s not like really inviting me. and that she’s gone soon. but mostly, that she’s not responding to passive aggressive messages. . kelly (o’brine) noticing my look before leaving. and talking through everything with me. clear, i guess, that i want to stay with alisse. but for her. or for ego?  talking to kelly but also just studying her face and her pupillary distance and oh okay i guess it’s attractive even though narrow like mine. —. new porches album = perfect for mood. —. good things with alisse. dinner with her and vira wednesday. chatting chatting good whatever cool normal. then vira leaving. good sex &amp; hangout. alisse looking at me in my eyes. deeply. i feel close. asking me to make plans to travel in may. okay. she really likes me. today though. not sleeping. loop / frustration with alisse her not caring. bad mood all day. face looks bad. things are not interesting. eating pretzels. can i just do more checklist items?  —. okay. going to talk to alisse. about travels. right right. but probably also more than travels because march she leaves leaves. so: do we want to stay together?  well. no. okay. first, the travel things. - i’m upset you invited me to travel, gave me an ultimatum, and then closed ultimatum (okay i’m just gonna go to hawaii). increasingly exclusionary. is this just like being casual and noncommittal or just non enthusiastic about traveling with me. - why did you decide hawaii before family trip if it’s more expensive?  - you should be more inviting if you really want me. you left no room to speculate with me. it’s all: if you wanted to plan something can fit you in. but okay this is more than travel:. - this is the first indication (in my eyes) that you care about me (why haven’t you told me still that you like me?). - also: you’re gone, effectively, from end march. and then your lease ends in jun. and that sucks and it’s upsetting. . next year. - i feel so close and intimate with you. in tune. physically, emotionally. like: i feel passionate about you romantically. but also practically. i think i can grow with you. . = now me, now. thinking about career this past week. the exposure i have is incredible. i still have lots of room to grow (1-2 years). realistically, i think, i want to stay here at least 1 more year. - i haven’t weighed these two things together. partly because i wanna know where you’re at. but. i want to explore being with you. okay. really, probably, what is driving my mood is a fear that alisse does not want to stay with me. but what if she doesn’t want this?  . 2/1. . mama’s bday. a call in the morning, on drive home. making cookie’s for kiddies. baba at beach with friends. nothing for mom planned. her bday not a bday. ‘how did you know it was my bday?’. i remembered mama. i remember. . this, after morning with alisse. sad face at my leaving to gym so quickly? but then - not mobilizing quickly enough. and so not able to make gym. alisse like: you should have gone. but honestly not phased. maybe like happy she wants me there. . don’t let yourself dissolve into relationship ether. less: gym, projects, me. but only 1.5 months of alisse. so whatever. . last night a bday day for alisse. in meeting: rhoda talking about her research is low priority. contradicting previous guidance and making alisse feel useless. (a talk, saturday, when may was here, about how alisse wanted explicit support twice: once when telling me she needs hug/had really bad day, and other time, when telling about sexual assault. me, draining support from her like all the time.) so had to show support. tasty momo with alisse for dinner. cuddling with her + cat momo for a while. talking about things things good sex falling asleep cuddling waking brushing teeth back to sleep up again hey cutie hey girl i really like you i wake up to you i like to wake up to you. . . now, kamasi washington playing. a mini yoga session now. a gym session in the morning. i need the gym. . my face long. these glasses make them longer, maybe. i don’t know. but my face is long it’s true and it’s factual. a comment by alisse. how my face made my hair look long. and then: morgan comparing to me ‘some guy in friend’s band, a doppelgänger’, who, it turns out is simon rodrigues. and like: i’m okay with that / i get it. but a bit about how his face is ‘a little wider’. they see. they see my narrow face. how does anyone like this face. and: exposing to alisse all these insecurities. because, during sex, thinking she’s not feeling it, when she totally was, and really just channeling my insecurities. . but no your face is okay some people think you’re cute? . . how many selfies / mirror stares to grow fond of face? so far in the hundreds, maybe thousands?

(the context - talking aboutt bidet/poops - farts - openness about that in a relationship). and maybe adding self-improvement advice in there for her to show i’m not the only flawed one. lots of time afterwards, me explaining how that was hurtful. in a cutting, rational, emotionally aware sort of way. okay i thought about that way too many times like 100x. not super weighing on me but a thing to think about. and then weighing on me maybe. (a tweet. today - inspired by mira gonzalez to tweet). . how jesse talked about how she was doing lots of work and then moved to big company and actually just realized she was not doing thing right and that quality was just lower (even though she had way more responsibility) . . today listening to podcast on which woman describes herself as shy, anxious - but also, has online presence being super self-effacing and embarrassing. how this, for her, serves as defense mechanism. because any criticism is unsurprising if you tear yourself apart. can relate. . a sudden momentum to switch to spotify. . giving thoughts legitimacy. a tricky thing to think about. . quite horny these days. weird. not even caffeine. or happiness bursting or anything. penis just want it. . missing alisse a lot. okay i do really love her. the practicality of love, thinking about it a lot lately. today, the two weeks ago thought stream of - should i even stay w alisse not arab/muslim who am i / identity / family all that - so foreign and like oh i’m me doing me what else chill don’t think 2 hard. supposed to write lots about that lately. oscillating a bit between: this girl is amazing and grounded and perfect on the important things vs where is my weird slightly destructive artsy romance. the latter - stupid. i think. . how you can overthink ui when you’re designing because so many tis just like okay. . this sudden realization that i talk a certain way, repeat certain phrases, things. . thinking a lot about application headers. okay sudden inspiration to redesign header. done. best version yet. . letting work fill the void friendships. dangerous?  . forth wanderers sound 2 good. . lunch with abhi me not present just like wowzie staring and occasionally listening super intensely then just wandering. . eating too fast lately all the sort of obsessive behaviors popping up. goal: kill these before hawaii, so i can enjoy travel trip me etc. . 5-6. . sink, i think, dripping. . looking at stowe places. lira’s rec. mornings: today, yesterday, lately, tea &amp; foam roll, breakfast. oh and cleaning up. . day beautiful. . thinking: i really should go to grad school. reasons not to = can just do stuff on my own (yes, true, but won’t be in the presence of creative weirdo smarties), no moneys (that’s okay), over qualification (that’s real). but really: master’s not worth it, unless lots of funding (the ideal). . super extremely horny yesterday like wake up from nap and bursting, need to do this before picking up guru the caterer. . this thought, weighing on me of: structured social interactions. dominate life moving forward. like i know this / knew this. but: internalizing, observing this now. because: casey, eric, vira leaving. no parties / crazy last nights out / etc etc. partly the atmosphere of this city maybe too. well no, don’t blame the city. but: incredibly sad. . looking up: above knee pain, behind knee pain. . when high today: thoughts for the twitter. but, did not write down. . easing restless yesterday. bike ride, hike, chilling outside with vira. euphoria. beautiful day. bike bike. ‘you bike like you drive’. hills. oof. wandering. a snake, running. snacks, joint, settling into the rock. chickpea collage, trader joe’s snacks spilling. not recalling what, exactly, but scattered, fun thoughts. ones for the insta. how talking about other people is a way to bond, get closer with the person you’re around. . . routine makes me sad. happiness is possibility.

maybe pulling grass. grass blade he is pulling is mid transition so still can talk. name is tooshie. also tooshie is like hey that hurts. and as this is happening, boy is distracted, his propeller cap flies away. and two themes converge: inattention to harm he is causing, and connectedness to larger ecosystem around him. boy having epiphany. meanwhile, propeller cap flies off boy, lands on plant. plant smiles. end of story. . maybe i should do a thing like - start with a prompt. and new story, everyday. creative therapy. less i focus on me, more i can think about me rationally. . keep in mind: the good lessons from acid. . self awareness in a good way. like detaching self from self and like oh i am this person alisse loves and i’m real and 3d and she sees me touches me and that our love is pretty less fragile than i imagine. . view jealousy as irrational. logic is your way out. . maybe -

morbid curiosity . going on quora for answers to my insecurities. self-love vs selfish. i need less of the latter (maybe not thaat much less), more of former. <br clear="none" />. okay. need to actually work on my thinking patterns. 'official love myself / insecurities document' - work to prevent thought patterns. but also need to build a library of positive thoughts. <br clear="none" />. ideas:. datavis therapy. <br clear="none" />. ultimately i think self-love should be fundamental. but i suppose i could build it up through situations?

<note><title>2018-8-20 interventions</title><content><![CDATA[<en-note>hey -. . some thoughts about — what i need to do to better support you. there are other things you talked about today too, and i want to talk about that later. . . you:. —. apart from family - you are the most important person to me. i care about you so so much. i go to sleep thinking about you, dream about you. i picture what you’re up to throughout the day. i make yelps because i really cannot find an adequate way to show you how much i love you. . you are in a new place, doing new things, doing well -- but also surrounded by people you’ve just met. your family is at home, your grandmother is sick. and you’re unable to see her. your boyfriend talks to you everyday, but never checks in. in fact, just shares his own problems (many of them trivial - requiring your comfort and emotional energy). . deserve a partner who knows how you’re feeling, who is anticipating your feelings, and trying to make you feel better. who helps you process your emotions and think through them. and makes you feel good, loved, and comforted. . . me:. —. . i’m going to include you on what i’ve been thinking - but, i don’t expect any response. i will work through this by myself, with friends, and with a therapist. you’ve provided way too much guidance, energy, and patience, and i don’t want to take more of that. . we’ve had a conversation about supporting you four times previously - and four times i felt extremely upset, guilty, and ready to change. i’ve said this is unacceptable, that this isn’t something i need to work on, but that i need to address this issue now. why haven’t i be become better at supporting you?  —. let me pick up at the last time we had this conversation. i remember how upset i was for you, and how urgently i wanted to make you feel comforted and loved. like i had so much love for you in me, i just wanted you to see it, and feel it. i would stay up, waiting for the next day to come, so i can be there for you. i made sure to ask you about your grandma was doing, how things were at home. to listen, and ask you again. for a week or two. and then i stopped. ever since you started med school. . i think: urgency was driving me to make these changes. i knew you were upset, i desperately wanted to make you feel better. and things became better (not actually - i mean, the urgency just went away because i was showing you support). and then i stopped asking. clearly - this was not a wake up call for me. each four of those times that we discussed me supporting you better, what i felt was more and more <span style="font-style: italic;">gravity</span>. i have a lot of confidence about how much i care about you / how i can express that. i thought that, with how much i love you and care about you, i would automatically adjust and be better for you. i did not go deeper in realizing what i’m doing wrong, what sort of issues are causing me to act like this. so — i didn’t actually identify anything specific that i needed to work on, beyond just ‘showing you that i care’. . that i was relying on urgency is: appalling. makes me sick thinking about this. that i’m only ready to comfort you only when you outwardly feel really bad, and explicitly tell me that? it’s not just bad support. it’s mean. . . there are some underlying issues that i need to address. this is not casual, this is not temporary, this is an intervention. (lack of) self-awareness is part of the problem (i’ll get to that in a bit) - but the bigger issue i think is that i am being too selfish, and not focusing enough on you. on your emotions. our dynamic is too much ‘you supporting me’. to change that, i want to: run any emotion problem/insecurity that relates to you by myself (writing), and a friend first. i want to bring less of my emotional weight. and ask you more about how you’re feeling (not just what you’re doing, and how you feel about specific situations). i want to focus more on your emotions, and less on mine (and not at all on irrational ones). also - i need to shatter this idea of you being ridiculously emotionally sound - this does get in the way of exploring your feelings. . . i need to work, also, on being more self-aware, and understanding what basis my thought patterns have. i will to go to therapy, to talk to friends, and write everyday (about how i’m feeling, and what i did, and whether i’ve been good to you). these are structured things that i can schedule, prioritize, and do. i am confident in that. . there is no doubt in my head about how much i care about you. i know that, i really do. that — is not the issue. but there are plenty of others that i will work to start addressing now. tomorrow, and everyday after that. . (i need to put way more thought into this, still thinking. but i’m going to share what i’ve written with you…). . —. i’m gonna stop and writing: think about what you’ve been feeling. how i’ve made you feel worse. i feel sick, i feel guilty, but i want to imagine, as vividly as i can, how you are feeling. . . . —. . cross it out . you selfish. cross it you yea selfish. cross it out . you selfish bitch. selfish . . . </en-note>]]></content><created>20180821T033849Z</created><updated>20190505T194425Z</updated><note-attributes><author>omarwnema@gmail.com</author><source>desktop.mac</source><reminder-order>0</reminder-order></note-attributes></note>
