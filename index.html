      <p>
        I am a: designer, strategist, and humanist. At work, I manage care-focused applications at Arcadia.io. The products I work on empower clinicians to manage patients' social and care needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since graduating with a Biomedical Engineering degree from Brown University in 2015, I have been drawn to creative, socially-minded applications of technology. In 2016, I moved from a data engineering position to product management in pursuit of a more craft-based, human-centered role.
      </p>
      <p>
        After taking root in digital product development, I started to abstract my work further. I took on strategic leadership of care-focused products in an effort to understand and broaden their impact. And outside of work

        Outside of work, I re-worked my professional projects into interactive data visuals. This curiousity bled into my personal life, as I've been exploring code as a means of facilitating and questioning social relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have developed a deep fascination for the interplay between data, technology, and the human experience - and I am looking for spaces to help cultivate this work further.
