<en-note><div>1-10</div><div>plane to lisbon.</div><div>right now you are (broad broad broad) 24 years old. sitting on dark plane, screen tilted, dimmed, writing. blasting kendrick and thinking of last summer. right now you are: 24.5 years old, living alone. your social life contained. a girlfriend - beautiful, grounded, smart. semi-fit. concerned with your appearance, the length of your face. friends are scattered, different, thoughtful, beautiful. style is better. you are a designer. a decent one, but not a great one. you are: somewhat talented at your job given the constraints (age , lack of experience). you are: feeling more close to family. you are: pierced, on both ears. you are: okay with your body, mostly. you are: thinking of aging. you are: less afraid of self-categorization. less afraid of you.</div><div>first hour, drifting drifting, tim hecker, drifting into sleep.</div><div>next 30 - rereading neuromancer (because, forgetting since it has taken me too long). much more enjoyable on reread. the environment making sense.</div><div>2 glasses of wine. awake despite no coffee. well 2 matcha.</div><div>matcha, today, at nine bar. prior to trip, looking up: spain. things to do. neighborhoods. alternative things. things. </div><div>lady clumsily bumping into headphone while walking by. and then noticing:: she has neck brace. the nth lesson in withhold judgment.</div><div>now - damn, kendrick playing. last summer flooding in memory. listening to damn on headphones near charles / mgh station. 'fear' playing. windy. not recalling hanging out, laughing, or any sort of concrete action. just the mental state i was in while listening. not easily described with words at my disposal. something like: living, carefree, grounded. energy is outward. feeling environment, absorbing taking engaging. energy spilling. less controlled. take it. you, have it. i don't care. take it.</div><div>other songs in album evoking this same feeling, though with less clarity.</div><div>and now, energy limited, contained. deliberate. an entity that requires thought to release. comes out on its own, but only when many factors constructively interering.</div><div>on the airplane, time feeling slower, beats slower, linger. the background in 'element'. the bass dropping slower. can pull it all apart.</div><div>'humble'. coming out before summer. but seeing the video. and feeling that mmph. 3x plays, bopping, ugh ugh.</div><div>'loyalty'. outside at some park. mystic park or something. with: eric, ahmed, siavash, arash. bumping out of the bluetooth speakers. smoking elevated, near the rocks. watching the kids. mush of conversation - easy, heartfelt - as i'm jamming.</div><div>'love'. simple and catchy, but from kendrick. questioning the indie in me.</div><div>'blood'. high, in my room, with arash, adam, siavash. blasting blasting the album for the first time. others drifting into sleep. cut to: describing album release party to alisse.</div><div>alisse: is an observer.</div><div>alisse: i'm okay with your mood swings. just how you express your emotions. think she means it.</div><div>be honest with yourself.</div><div>a sudden bout of - reflection - lately.</div><div>spill ooze ooze</div><div>brain__spill.</div><div>in logan. eating at generic healthy fast food place. as if mottos were generalized, copied from something, somewhere. and seeing that all workers there are 3arab. </div><div>receiving the 'chicken chopstick bowl' (no chopsticks included, or available). mishearing the hijabi handing food to me. and self-conscious, the 'am i real arab' thoughts surfacing. coupled with: a thank you / shukran mumble. </div><div>knowing your limitations: is what is needed for success really. because: world is replete with resources (to learn or do). i just need to know what i need. i need to know what i'm poorly. the thought prompted by early days as designer. got a lot of direction from nick. saying something like 'having trouble starting design language, plz help.</div><div>back to the involution design sessions. how do our designs compare? what's thoughtful about theirs? how did they deal with care plan? i suppose the same as ours.</div><div>care plans - biggest gap in new care mgmt features. needs to be: more condensed. task checklist will work maybe, if we make it easier to add new intervention. (just add the care plan restyle into 4.15, no approval needed). do what i need to make this good. add UX tickets. do it. be rogue. also: need a design sprint between 4.16 and 4.17. </div><div>*link to care plan review, directly from care plan page</div><div>*link to portions of care plan review from care plan page. like 'add note to goal'. hm. </div><div>*how can we actually train people to use this?</div><div>everybody (alisse especially) leaving boston prompting me to think of next step. next step. in my professional career. this is where i am.</div><div>feeling super thankful for job this week. partly after going on / ranting about how i'm lucky to have it, saturday night at saloon with alisse. but also: imagine i didn't get this. where i would be. at a company. slowly climbing the ranks. maybe a newly crowned senior analyst. maybe back in school doing CS. or at an okay design school. all to prep to get to: where i am now.</div><div>okay dangerous tendencies in relationship: </div><div>- always putting hanging with alisse over others. or: not fully committing to spreading out, getting into a chill session. lingering in the back of head: need to see alisse by end of night.</div><div>- not spending as much time doing the tangible things that i have discernment in / use as means of self-gratification. design projects. </div><div>- not writing</div><div>really: moving my vaidation from above to alisse. i suppose not terrible. like if we break up, a transition period where validation moves back to above? or maybe, entire self destroyed, dissolved.</div><div>nick like 'i trust you..well, i trust you now' when it comes to design. agreeing. like damn i really sucked. and still not a 'good desgner'. just a decent one, that can make something intuitive. but not beautiful. pleasant. work on that work on that.</div><div>nick: truly amazing at his job. but also: work and then sleep. how does he feel about this? what is his relationship with girlfriend like? does he talk of work developments?</div><div>bad work things. committing to loading goals, interventions, but erm not getting it done in time. and now leaving leaving. nick taking this well, on appearance. but me: not really apologizing. just like. no. this isn't gonna happen.</div><div>not smiling at people. reaching out. asking about their days. being social.</div><div>ambitions naturally change in winter, way more productive. it's true it's true.</div><div>recalling all the shitty stories i wrote in 'fiction i'. how can i get to be a better fiction writer?</div><div>and: conversation with yahya day before yesterday.</div><div>talking about: visa situation. yahya accepting that he will likely be immigrant for much of his life. asylum case in 1.5 years.</div><div>yahya - always speaking at a broad / philosphical / reflective level.</div><div>his progression with meditation. clarity</div><div>yahya's point that meditation brings you clarity, which grounds, you, makes you feel good. discussing a 'hypothetical' example - how do you deal with case in which you're unhappy about appearance? yahya echoing an idea that it's better to know that you're ugly? do i agree? the healthy, meditation-based process: okay, do looks prevent me from what i want to get? (success, girls, a: no?). do i actually look bad or is it just me? </div><div>spending 5 days in a row with alisse. all quite good. great sex the whole time. except last day. working, alisse keeping company. eating with her. not much to talk about but like relaxing and chilling and i think it's good? stretching, too. seeing how: good chilling isn't really sustainable though. spending more time will inevitably sacrifice the quality. what arises instead: a coexistence that can maybe be beautiful? or: you live together, but lead busy lives in which the respective selves of fulfilled irrespective of partner (douchey wording)</div><div>these thoughts leading me into marriage? can i / one / mostly i have an _actively_ happy marriage. yes underscore = italics.</div><div>feeling like i'm less idealistic. (don't say that, don't say that).</div><div>getting ride with alisse to airport. a quickie, prior to leaving. </div><div><br/></div></en-note>

(a talk, saturday, when may was here, about how alisse wanted explicit support twice: once when telling me she needs hug/had really bad day, and other time, when telling about sexual assault. me, draining support from her like all the time.) so had to show support. tasty momo with alisse for dinner. cuddling with her + cat momo for a while. talking about things things good sex falling asleep cuddling waking brushing teeth back to sleep up again hey cutie hey girl i really like you i wake up to you i like to wake up to you. </div><div><br/></div><div>now, kamasi washington playing. a mini yoga session now. a gym session in the morning. i need the gym.</div><div><br/></div><div>my face long. these glasses make them longer, maybe. i don’t know. but my face is long it’s true and it’s factual. a comment by alisse. how my face made my hair look long. and then: morgan comparing to me ‘some guy in friend’s band, a doppelgänger’, who, it turns out is simon rodrigues. and like: i’m okay with that / i get it. but a bit about how his face is ‘a little wider’. they see. they see my narrow face. how does anyone like this face. and: exposing to alisse all these insecurities. because, during sex, thinking she’s not feeling it, when she totally was, and really just channeling my insecurities.</div><div><br/></div><div>but no your face is okay some people think you’re cute? </div><div><br/></div><div>how many selfies / mirror stares to grow fond of face? so far in the hundreds, maybe thousands?</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></en-note>

you, someone making fun of me behind my back? yea it is chill in that situation, most of the time. embarrassing me in front of jesse like that. and also the personality implications of being bottled up.</div><div>(the context -

hey i should have been more upset that time. and that other time after providence. except i was actually just annoying. but it took a lot to make her apologize. but idk i see why. overall. those two incidents unrelated. this is not a broad trend. this is just a thought. a one time thing.</div><div><br /></div><div>thursday</div><div>- sunrise on beach. coffee, banana, packing. poops (encore).</div><div>- straight to awa’awapuhi trail. two lookouts. shit damn wow at view.</div><div>- downhill hike. into the ridges. sea, sky blending.</div><div>- up, quickly.</div><div>- named lookouts. rainy, foggy. retreating into car.</div><div>- stumbling into waimea canyon lookout. ‘grand canyon of pacific’. green blue orange crayons canyon tooo baf</div><div>- fish market. matcha. on the curb. airport.</div><div><br /></div><div>friday</div><div>~trip~</div><div>-morning: taking care of the fridge man</div><div>-deciding to just trip near the house</div><div><br /></div><div>saturday</div><div>-morning: coffee, lingering in house. farmer’s market.</div><div>-serious talks</div><div>-lunch at grandma’s</div><div>-back home. finishing card, packing.</div><div>-chilling with the family. fixing the tv.</div><div>-off to dinner at roy’s (alisses’ family favorite)</div><div>-back from dinner. awkwardly giving out card. exclaiming ‘i wrote a card’. rather than like ‘hey thank you, here’s a card to show my gratitude’.</div><div>annotations</div><div><br /></div><div>5-24</div><div><br /></div><div>like: write your good thoughts down lately</div><div>because lately: bad bad thoughts</div><div>today, kind of level. work zone, i think = not thinking of self, sort of helping. theory: maybe just restless, so, in hawaii, early, not in zone to chill, let bad thoughts fill me up. unable to just ~be~ observe.</div><div><br /></div><div>i guess - goal in life - not happiness, but i think desires aligning with actions. like  doing what i feel like. or - what i feel like doing, is i want to feel like doing. maybe: being the person i want to be. like. living up to this theoretical image. i don’t know.</div><div><br /></div><div>oh alisse asking what sort of children’s story i want to write. and thinking: theme of growth. in texts: whole world is growing and changing and bloopy. and inanimate objects transition to lifeforms to people or maybe just people like things. and this one human is plopped into this world and doesn’t understand this interconnectedness, this ebb and flow. boy comes in, wearing a propeller cap, overalls. nice and cute but unaware of his impact. inconsiderate. boy is caught doing something low-key destructive - maybe pulling grass. grass blade he is pulling is mid transition so still can talk. name is tooshie. also tooshie is like hey that hurts. and as this is happening, boy is distracted, his propeller cap flies away. and two themes converge: inattention to harm he is causing, and connectedness to larger ecosystem around him. boy having epiphany. meanwhile, propeller cap flies off boy, lands on plant. plant smiles. end of story.</div><div><br /></div><div>maybe i should do a thing like - start with a prompt. and new story, everyday. creative therapy. less i focus on me, more i can think about me rationally.</div><div><br /></div><div>keep in mind: the good lessons from acid</div><div><br /></div><div>self awareness in a good way. like detaching self from self and like oh i am this person alisse loves and i’m real and 3d and she sees me touches me and that our love is pretty less fragile than i imagine</div><div><br /></div><div>view jealousy as irrational. logic is your way out.</div><div><br /></div><div>maybe -

(lack of) self-awareness is part of the problem (i’ll get to that in a bit) - but the bigger issue i think is that i am being too selfish, and not focusing enough on you. on your emotions. our dynamic is too much ‘you supporting me’. to change that, i want to: run any emotion problem/insecurity that relates to you by myself (writing), and a friend first. i want to bring less of my emotional weight. and ask you more about how you’re feeling (not just what you’re doing, and how you feel about specific situations). i want to focus more on your emotions, and less on mine (and not at all on irrational ones). also - i need to shatter this idea of you being ridiculously emotionally sound - this does get in the way of exploring your feelings. </div><div><br /></div><div>i need to work, also, on being more self-aware, and understanding what basis my thought patterns have. i will to go to therapy, to talk to friends, and write everyday (about how i’m feeling, and what i did, and whether i’ve been good to you). these are structured things that i can schedule, prioritize, and do. i am confident in that.</div><div><br /></div><div>there is no doubt in my head about how much i care about you. i know that, i really do. that — is not the issue. but there are plenty of others that i will work to start addressing now. tomorrow, and everyday after that.</div><div><br /></div><div>(i need to put way more thought into this, still thinking. but i’m going to share what i’ve written with you…)</div><div><br /></div><div>—</div><div>i’m gonna stop and writing: think about what you’ve been feeling. how i’ve made you feel worse. i feel sick, i feel guilty, but i want to imagine, as vividly as i can, how you are feeling. </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>—</div><div><br /></div><div>cross it out </div><div>you selfish</div><div>cross it you yea selfish</div><div>cross it out </div><div>you selfish bitch</div><div>selfish </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></en-note>]]></content><created>20180821T033849Z</created><updated>20190505T194425Z</updated><note-attributes><author>omarwnema@gmail.com</author><source>desktop.mac</source><reminder-order>0</reminder-order></note-attributes></note>

talking to may) about how i need to assert myself more. how absence of that has hurt me. made it hard for her to see my viewpoint. given her a lot of power.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">how: this is normal relationship stuff. transitions. kind of extreme. but like, shouldn’t give on it.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">how: i have made progress. she’s judging progress arbitrarily.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">the concept of ‘work’. putting in ‘work’. maybe obsessing over that too much, i think her thinking of stress.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">optimism and how we love each other and be together and the stress will logically be less once we clarity.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">what started this</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">how this process has revealed a lot of our tendencies</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">from me: you need better emotional support. respect for your space. trust in your love. withhold sadness when trying to communicate emotions?</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">if we break it down this way we can determine is it worth it?</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">from you: i need expectations (how frequently to talk etc, what it will be like when i visit you). i need to feel included in your med school life. to be open with me. to be a bit more forward when expressing when emotions. </span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">what makes me confident: we have had very few conversations about this</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">intuitively i think - i would so down to do those things for you and to commit to being better at that. </span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale

history:</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">should i revisit last week? maybe? went like —</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">friday some nice texts but no i love you (as i get delayed, calling me bibi baby etc, relaying my flight patterns to everyone). </span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">saturday angry with me upon arrival. some tender hugs &amp; sex. hike (talking about me and my ambitions and that’s nice). then beach. phoebe’s later, home, feeling distant. </span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">sunday: i think..working for some of day. venice/ice cream at night. hanging is okay but don’t feel loved.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">monday or tues: me crying at night. her mean, unsympathetic.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">tues: going into day like maybe i should end this. coming back from class, sushi dinner. alisse excited about classwork. going on run. leaving, coming back (while i am cooking) and all of a sudden: affectionate. hugging me tightly before bed.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">wednesday i think dinner. her at class mostly, and then making dinner. positive during the day, except when mentioning the talk and her getting ‘stressed out’. waiting to talk. crying. alisse slightly more sympathetic and seeing that i do indeed love her.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">thursday — during the day, walking with tanya. going crazy, conversations with alisse out loud. crying in car. so much pain. me, more calm eventually. dinner just me and her: either cooking or going out. a talk eventually at night. her like: you fix this. kind of saying that she’ll help out a little (‘be available for questions’). that’s all i asked for. and then hooking up.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">friday: relatively nice during day. morning, nice. doing things, cooking. and then feeling a flip when i get flowers. like just a light kiss. and during dinner her super distant / not introducing me to anyone. and then: the fight. sleeping at tanya’s.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">saturday: crazy turbulent during the day. then nice conversation. alisse finally saying ‘i love you’ on her own. really nice time at the getty. fight at night tho.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">sunday: okay mood. both of us exhausted. rational conversation at the end, and — a break.</span></div><div><br clear="none" /></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">talk on saturday. </span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">&gt; why didn’t i come

them, then you can go on a walk</span></div><div><br clear="none" /></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">thinking today about. well i don’t know if thinking critically so much as continuing to have imaginary conversations. not sure really any new revelations since yesterday. last night: reading alisses’ cards and like damn she really loves me. scouring for the birthday card but can’t find. found the other two from past month: lil card from seattle (‘i am filled with joy when i think about us’) and cute cute card when i had my day off (‘you are so smart and strong and don’t let these weirdos get in your way’). like damn i love that girl.</span></div><div><br clear="none" /></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">thinking about: like long-term things. and the fact that even if we wanna work this out. i have to move soon.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">some sadness realizing that alisse may just not want to continue</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">and.. idk walk time</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">that i actually was making progress in supporting her and she wasn’t seeing it (**)</span></div><div><br clear="none" /></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">deciding: lift, get muscles now.</span></div><div><br clear="none"

but moving out etc. i don’t know. maybe it’s not the right time. maybe this won’t be a fulfilling relationship. i don’t need the time but i need the love. </span></div><div><br clear="none" /></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">stopping by work drink thing hi bye </span></div><div><br clear="none" /></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">dinner w trisha, friend from wesleyan (rachel) and her coworker. she okay honestly. categorized/judged by me as new england white girl. her story of transferring from connecticut college, in detail. trisha's relationship issues. nice to have company but really not feeling the veggie galaxy / diner vibe. and this feeling building up of: these are not my people. how, that wesleyan crew i'm down for when alisse is around. see the best in them. and now like eh these aren't my people. i mean trisha a homie but i don't know.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">meeting w casey and delphine at liquor store. back to my house, drinking bottle of wine. baby joint. talking about. things. tesla and being a factory worker there. factory talk. apple too. and foxcon, this enormous factory complex that hires seasonal workers for different tech companies. how phones are assembled manually largely. power structures n things. casey's new pickup truck and california.</span></div><div><br clear="none" /></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">9/21 (writing 9/22)</span></div><div><br clear="none" /></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">work from home. because sleeping late, waking late. cm issue meeting and my patience wearing thin. screenshare with joe previous day and...patience wearing thin. channeling: overall frustration, but also recent realization that i do not like conflict, that i compromise -- and combating with assertion. it feels. bad. maybe. being less open. and this is a good trait. but when conversation gets circular. when i have listened to other person and they have not listened to me -- and when, i am the decision maker, i need to override. end. move on. with joe: this is circular. we are going for a certain ui quality. period. implement it how you want. so much complaining about how hard these styles are to re-use. you can make reuable components man. i don't know. understand that here are constraints and that we are working within them.</span></div><div><br clear="none" /></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">taking nap and deciding: no more work. balling but too windy. and me a little too stiff from lifting. so then off to gym. giving casey car keys.</span></div><div><br clear="none" /></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">then bbq at night. usual wholesome crew: jackie, brant, aaron, jacob, graham, two other engineers, casey + delph, harvard grad (destiny, sahar, bryan, other british guy). overall, a comforting night with 'deep' (maybe too many) conversations. kind of chilling small talking. jackie walks in and asks how i've been. delving into relationship issues. jackie talking about what she's learned about attachment styles. doesn't really apply to alisse. i mean: the way she wanted me to show her grand love does. but the overall tendencies of her in the past (to trust me, not need reassurance) does not follow. she does not have attachment issues really. describing then: how she's treated me. jackie totally with me on how painful that is. and how weird it is that nothing like this has ever happened. but also understanding how alisse was upset. anyway blah blah the only thing that does add up really as causes for fueling this fire are </span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">1) her not being able to take criticism </span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">2) being tired at reassuring me </span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">3) me not standing up for myself / her not seeing progress i've made </span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">4) me not standing up for myself / her seeing my need for reassurance as petty and taking up more space and</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">5) more ambiguous: something else going on w her. maybe: wanting to explore being bi (maybe not?). maybe: </span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">--</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">6) her not seeing my viewpoint / not letting me express that</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">7) her not expressing her viewpoint (because stress stress stress).</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">--</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">okay let's abstract this. from the causes to the patterns. one level less deep.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">1) alisse not seeing my viewpoint</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">2) alisse not expressing herself</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">3) me continuing to fuck up..</span></div><div><br clear="none" /></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">talking to jackie also about religion. how losing it makes her feel a sense of emptiness. and to others who grew up non religiously as to whether it is easier to make meaning (since not losing something). me ending (mentally) with conflusion that: yes, if you abandon everything religion gave you then you will be truly lost. but not all of it is bad. take it as a starting point for developing your own framework.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">other questions: what makes you feel manly (from destiny). how often do you shave your balls. things things things. how do people interact and socialize and where i fit in the world and things i am thinking, thinking aobut..</span></div><div><br clear="none" /></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">9/22</span></div><div><br clear="none" /></div><div><span style="font-family:

</div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">progress of thoughts:</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">- immediately: relief, and a need to work on myself/catch up on work. anxiety going away.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">- initially: continuing to blame myself for that saturday argument, but also understanding that i did have a legit viewpoint.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">- 'these are just standard relationship issues'</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">- super motivated to work on myself.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">- anger at alisse for the way she treated me. that she handled this super irrationally and that she should never treat me this way. that i should be with someone who treats me like this. that she made me play this game of winning her love. that she held back affection and took advantage of how far i would go for her.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">- still motivated to work on myself but some sadness at things with alisse. realizing that maybe it won't work out.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">now, understanding that: our relationship should not be categorized as stress. that this situation resulted from: a lack of communication, constantly overstepping missed expectations/being upset with the other, feedback loops. and that, we can make this work. </span></div><div><br clear="none" /></div><div><br clear="none" /></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">to alisse i want to communicate:</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">--</span></div><div><br clear="none" /></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">the investment in her and why i needed so much reassurance</span></div><div><br clear="none" /></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">--categorizing this conflict--</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">repeating above: a lack of communication, constantly overstepping missed expectations/being upset with the other, feedback loops. and that, that is the stress. you are not the stress, and i am not. we can make each other feel so good. </span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">that we are both going through transitions. that we haven't been challenged in this way and that we've responded to the challenge poorly. </span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">we haven't communicated very much.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">we were in a good place.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">context: investment, transitions. and you also going through hard stuff.</span></div><div><br clear="none" /></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">the question we started the break at: i want to be with you, but this is stressful. my answer: there are reasons why this has been stressful. we can address them and work on them. </span></div><div><br clear="none" /></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">i don't think it's productive to think of this as: i want to be with you, but will this be stressful? i think that we can break down the stress and understand what we each need, whether we can make it work for each other. and if we don't respect those things (within some understanding that there will be missteps) then the answer is there.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">me -- i have been doing things for her. i am compassionate, i care, and i can change for myself and for someone i care about. i am smart and sensitive. that i want this to work. i don't play games. i am a good partner in a lot of ways, and can be a better one.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">moving forward we need to think about:</span></div><div><br clear="none" /></div><div><br clear="none" /></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">how to convey above to alisse while also getting her feelings. guiding conversation without dominating. a bit more forward with expression emotions.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">expectations and to feel included. opening up.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">you need support and space</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">9-26</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono';">morning. not feeling good. because although i care little about hearing from alisse, i do still care. last night. a good night snap. reciprocated with a good night snap. that’s cool i suppose. but no saving my snaps lately. no ‘you look cute’. okay whatever not a big deal that’s fine. but other things: calling me mid-day - i thought to say, but instead to ask, somewhat panicked / accusingly where her whitecoat is (i folded all her clothes). whatever. next reply to my text asking where she found it (3pm) came at 10. i’m explaining my day, mentioned dreary weather, and her just saying ‘sorry the weather isn’t good!’. that too not a big deal, at least she’s sympathetic. but then mentioning ‘oh boston, this is your life now’. depressing, thank you for confirming. and then asking if i’m sleeping, and just giving a ‘good night!’. peppering in ‘sleep well’. waiting for me to say i love you?

<note><title>2018-10-15 / lisse time</title><content><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE en-note SYSTEM "http://xml.evernote.com/pub/enml2.dtd"><en-note><div>monday, 10-15 </div><div>—</div><div>alisse just leaving now. a list of things we did:</div><div><br /></div><div>thurs:</div><div>wake up, pick up alisse at 5:45.</div><div>back at home for ~good cuddles~. sleeping, up for work while alisse continues to sleep.</div><div>making halloumi bread egg cheese veggie brunch feast around 11:30.</div><div>meeting and then: gen sou en. good vibe. working. showing alisse my work and she is like oo that’s cool. bookstore after. cute book with kawaii drawings. comparing ourselves to different drawings (foods, appliances, etc). alisse always painting as cute cool spunky love loving.</div><div>back home for a bit before dinn. go out or stay in? ‘i want to go out with you!’</div><div>so we go to casa b. oh well actually: a quickie before (got a little nervous when having sex earlier that day). what we are talking about? oh i don’t know. vibe of restaurant. i think things at med school. but it’s light and nice. walking outside for a lil after, and then cab to trisha’s. hanging chilling and it’s good until we watch 20 minutes of nature bro (basically kind of street-like dude saying nature things). home and sleepy and sleep.</div><div><br /></div><div>fri:</div><div>wake up work up. ammar and alisse to meet trisha downtown for lunch. trisha bails because work award. so, mid-cooking, decide to cook a lil extra and have them over. chill. they meet trisha for coffee later, me doe off to tamper for a bit.</div><div>alisse back, middlesex. beautifall. spot outside with boston skyline. standing, staring, walking around slowly.</div><div>dinner with michelle (cousin) &amp; jeff. jeff a corny dad type, but nice enough. michelle soft spoken inward type. indian food. lots of it. honeycomb after.</div><div>alisse then: out with brandy ryan. me somehow jealous because i know ryan asked her out once? but mostly okay. chilling, yoga / cleaning and then big mouth. and when alisse saying she is coming home after 2 hours or so, replying with ‘okay :)’. contrast to last time i was left alone fri night. and alisse coming home, affectionate. talking to me about us. how she notices how much more confident i am and how it makes her feel more confident in us. basically that this is what she wanted. yay cool. cuddles n sleep.</div><div><br /></div><div>saturday:</div><div>wake up for brunch. me up a lil earlier. ordering clothes online, tea so i can poop. alisse up, we out. finding out trisha, ammar lily will be hour late. whoopsie. off to barrington to sip coffee and travel plan. then meeting for brunch at committee. good light time. food okay tho. afterward, to davis. thrift shopping at first. alisse seeing my heart eyes at her in cute light blue princess like dress and buying dress basically because of that.</div><div><br /></div><div>sunday:</div><div>prov day. alisse w katie first for brunch. me, workout n stuff. then we go apple picking (alisse excited for this). we pick pick. alisse wanting me to lead the way but i am a little indecisive. that’s okay tho. a nice time. quick stop at india point park. pretty sunset. off to dinner after. this all like good i think but maybe slight strain from jealousy previous night. feeling a bit more anxious like wanting to fill air with words. this comes up at dinner (bigking, sister of north). alisse being reassuring for a bit. dinner overall good but kind of losing appetite from jealousy. prospect park after. fun, making out, and emerging to crowd. but like not magical. and then we drive back. drive okay smooth. watch a little tv. i think alisse feeling pressured for sex maybe? anyway, closes her eyes. shuts me out. i’m anxious and want her to help me. eventually ask her to hold my hand and breathe in and out with me. she’s kind of receptive and gives me quick squeeze.</div><div><br /></div><div>monday:</div><div>waking up and being cuddly / giggle with alisse even tho felt awful in the morning. feeling awful in the morning b/c of jealousy last night and lack of sex. like bad bad bad. this is a bad feeling. continuing thru morning. after meeting, coming down and saying i’m sleepy. alisse tucking me in. cutie. damn she was quite nice to me. what is my reality. anyway, wake up, work a bit. feeling better. alisse making snack. thanks thanks. then we cook stuff. it’s good and we’re good but i’m anxious. i tell alisse that ‘hey i hope you see that i’m still working on myself’. and she’s like yea i told you that whatever. she tells me she was upset that i was being a bit pushy with sex this weekend (which made her not want to). i say sorry, we hug. while apple crisp is in oven. done, and we are outside, eating the crisp. alisse taking me back home, throwing me on bed, and sexy time. this was better. felt more natural. did not get ‘lost in it’ but physically things felt good. shower, helping lisse pack, then she out. last words at airport ‘1 month is not far away. i love you’.</div><div><br /></div><div>—</div><div>how would i feel if someone was jealous about my past experience?</div><div><br /></div><div>what she loves about me:</div><div><ul><li><font style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Consolas;">my weirdness, spontaneity, freeness. cute cool weird stylish.</span></font></li><li><font style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Consolas;">does not like: lack of confidence.</span></font></li></ul></div><div><br /></div><div>for therapy:</div><div><ul><li><font style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Consolas;">we did lots things (see above) but bad things left huge imprint</span></font></li><li><font style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Consolas;">i am a human tho and i have issues with jealousy and i gotta get over that</span></font></li><li>overall revising my reality retroactively is a difficult thing to do</li><li>like i feel confident when i am doing things but that seems unsustainable</li><li>confidence is good for me but at the same time feeling pressure to be confident is tough.</li><li>emphasis on needing quality experience</li></ul><div><br /></div></div><div><span style="font-family: Consolas;">examples of me going overboard</span></div><div><ul><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">like after inviting me to thanksgiving wanting to ask again and make sure it’s okay.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;"><span style="font-family: Consolas;">fri night</span> jealous for a second when out with coworkers — no reason at all why — and wanting to look through messages</span></li></ul></div><div><br /></div><div>good things</div><div><ul><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">random ‘i love you’ + kiss while walking around saturday</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">alisse seeing how heart eyes i am </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">it was hot seeing how comfortable you were when you were dancing</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">last things: ‘you’re the best’ / i love you final moments before leaving. screenshot of my photo. holding hands on ride back.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">affection hugs cuddles</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">inviting me to thanksgiving. plans for new york in april too.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">dancing very hard and feeling loose n comfortable.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">talk on friday. alisse saying is happy for me and feels more confident in us.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">alisse saying i should lower expectations of myself, that she does believe i am doing better and has told me that (when asking for verification that she stills that in me even when i have slip ups)</span></li></ul></div><div><br /></div><div>bad things </div><div><ul><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">jealousy finding out about alisses’ sexual past in group</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">not that much sex / turning alisse off b/c coming on too strongly with sex couple times when she didn’t want</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">invalidating all the good things after a bad thing happened (i.e., yea she was affectionate but that was saturday before i was jelly)</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">counting things like how many times we had sex</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">love literally wavering with handholding</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">that bad feeling <span style="font-family: Consolas;">monday morning</span></span></li></ul></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>googling as first comfort</div><div><br /></div><div>— </div><div><br /></div><div>I NEED TO BE MORE CONFIDENT IT’S GOOD FOR ME AND HER</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>10-17 / therapy</div><div>—</div><div><br /></div><div>things sticking out from what andrea said:</div><div><ul><li><font><font face="Consolas">thinking about, right before leaving. convo with alisse before leaving. where i am like ‘ah you know i can’t always be perfect and sometimes will get upset’. and how she was a little short with me but also like ‘you’re not perfect’. and then afterwards, throwing me on bed to sex (after sensing i feel bad about sex things). this is a nice gesture. definitely. a good thing. and she loves me and cares about me and is showing me that maybe she’s okay with my insecurity. and then: i love you, 1 month is not far away. she was nice and affectionate as usual.</font><br /></font></li><li><font><font face="Consolas">feeling exhausted just talking about alisse more and like ugh can i stop talking about this. i feel like even andrea is. so i need to focus on myself.</font></font></li><li><font><font face="Consolas">a comment that alisse needs to accept both sides of me. but andrea also just starting to realize i have these two sides. so prob shouldn’t let this weigh too heavily. and alisse has accepted it for a while but just wants to me work on it. if she don’t like me while i work on it then not my fault. yes my insecurity is a part of me.</font></font></li><ul><li><font><font face="Consolas">**so basically stop feeling bad when i feel insecure**. quick apology, acknowledgement that i struggle with this, and that i am working on it.</font></font></li></ul><li><font><font face="Consolas">her kind of just repeating my thoughts about feeling sexual insecurity / jealousy. which was: i can believe that i am the best, or i can believe that it don’t matter. </font></font></li></ul><div><font face="Consolas"><br /></font></div></div><div><font face="Consolas">okay, distill:</font></div><div><ul><li><font style="font-size: 14px;" face="Consolas">maybe it’s okay if confidence is this thing that needs maintenance. self-love vs confidence.</font><br /></li><li><font face="Consolas">stop feeling bad about being insecure that’s a part of me and sometimes there’s a beauty to my self-doubt.</font></li><li><font face="Consolas">less relationship more me</font></li><li><font face="Consolas">i need to internalize the positive things said to me</font></li></ul></div><div><br /></div><div>--</div><div>love is stop thinking about love. love is project endlessly. love is think endlessly. love is a trap. </div><div>quick

<note><title>2018-10-24</title><content><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE en-note SYSTEM "http://xml.evernote.com/pub/enml2.dtd"><en-note><div>therapy debrief n such</div><div>—</div><div>going to therapy like work meeting with ‘here’s what i need to get out of this session’ (identify all of my problems clearly and then track progress towards them) but like yo chill it’s exploratory, need to have therapist guide it a little bit.</div><div><br /></div><div>okay start of session. explaining how last time what stayed with me is that i didn’t notice positive things until andrea pointed it out. and how, throughout the week, i was able to notice that in real time. like how i noticed my cycle for love reset. like on friday alisse telling me ‘good night babe. i love you (heart)’. on sunday, friends gone, not hearing much, and feeling like i need affection. asking to talk on phone but getting ‘can i let you know in a bit’. which is actually communicative and nice. and then asking me to talk at 10, but me asleep. calling alisse sleepily for a bit.</div><div><br /></div><div>other bits andrea said:</div><div><ul><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">you are very high-functioning. smart, good social relationships, job, etc. i don’t want to pathologize you, want to keep in mind that we are picking apart at small things.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">‘highly </span><span style="font-family: Consolas;">unlikely’ that i will turn into the confident douchebag that i hate. you are too self-aware. and this isn to what you like.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">object permanence. how this relates to relationships. like you see something, don’t see it, don’t believe it.</span></li></ul></div><div><br /></div><div>so the things i have to do:</div><div><ul><li><span style="font-size: 14px;">know that feelings/things don’t change too much day to day (unless something big happened)</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Consolas;">make positive lists of relationship affirmation.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14px;">will this just make me on the lookout for stuff even more? well no, i already am on the lookout. this just </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 14px;">when i get the need for affirmation: </span><span style="font-size: 14px;">notice it. give it a name. that voice. omarita.</span></li><ul><li>do something, specific to the situation: how should i deal it this time? be active? should i distract myself with tv? should i look at positive list? should i read? should i listen to music? </li><li>try to remember to discuss in therapy (this feeling that i won’t even get this feeling because i need to talk about it in therapy like omg stop being annoying of course you

Consolas;">Skype, when not talking, feeling uneasy/not confident in us. but then getting random little smiles from alisse.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">sun, not getting immediate response to talk and </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">getting jealous on saturday when hearing about hike + wanting to trip with </span><span style="font-family: Consolas;">miriam</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">even when alisse booking trip on sun/mon, her saying ‘yep’ to thank you instead of ‘yay np, i’m excited!’ getting to me for a hot sec</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">not wanting to talk when things are on a good note</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">asking how dinner was and only hearing about the food and wanting to hear about vibes. but food is important to alisse this is okay.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">reluctant to say i love you because not knowing what i’ll get back</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">checking google photos comments</span></li></ul><div><ul><li>sunday 10/29: <span style="font-family: Consolas;">kept up with a background/backcurrent/current of thoughts. some of them related to jealousy. i think maybe spurred by me saying ‘good night my love’ and getting ‘good night habibi’ back? totally appropriate. girl been showing me love too.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">this feeling of ‘there’s this thing in my head and i don’t like it’ when having these thoughts. an improvement.</span></li></ul></div><div><br /></div></div><div><span style="font-family: Consolas;">good things to share: wanting to tell alisse: thank you for sharing lil details of your day. want to hear more.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Consolas;">dysmorphic type thoughts</span></div><div><ul><li><font style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Consolas;">the gap in my teeth</span></font></li><li><font style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Consolas;">relationship with working out in the past</span></font></li><li><font style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Consolas;">glasses and how i hate them</span></font></li><li><font style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Consolas;">just extremely focused on the shape of my face</span></font></li></ul></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Consolas;">10-27</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Consolas;">last night w reef watching ‘the man who stole banksy’ (part of palestine film fest). awful movie sparking various half-hearted intellectual debates. like - should street art be taken out of it’s context? in some way validating for the artist that it’s gallery material. but also ceases to be street art. what is the legality of stealing street art? alongside banksy’s images in palestine. and how one guy ‘walid the beast’ — helped carve out a banksy painting with israeli soldiers checking a donkey’s ID (offensive obvs). and kind of making fun of walid. also interspersed with weird montages of walid working out. and then palestinian singing and rapping. truly a mess. and clearly directed by white person.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Consolas;">a drink after. me not super present. then and before. the phone checking what am i doing type of restlessness. which, i feel bad about with reef. because he’s talking about his dad and brother and true emotional things and i yawn and he asks if maybe we should head out. and as we’re about to leave i start giving some meaningful thoughts to compensate.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Consolas;">i step outside and i’m not a mess and my thoughts are in control and i’ve been productive and i’m going to head out with a friend - and good things, all good things — but it’s underwhelming. something is underwhelming. nothing is underwhelming. but i’m underwhelmed. it’s quiet outside. these white people. etc.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Consolas;">oh killing time in trident bookstore and reading rupi kaur. poet. but poems with some narrative, continuity. like: maybe i should get into this, write, read. at the end of some her poems, signing them with an emotion (‘- jealousy’). reminiscent of the lists.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Consolas;">spill spill</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Consolas;">thinking: i have lots of thoughts, and need to process, write, but don’t want to write. laziness.</span></div><div><br /></div><div>i say dumb things but people say dumb things</div><div><br /></div><div>listening to podcast about body dysmorphia. relating (bring up in therapy). this feeling that i’m not alone. like therapeutic (but making me feel also like my emotions are not that complex). hope in pathologizing in this case. like - maybe i am pretty but i see myself differently. almost like i’m on shrooms. i mean, true that i am not looking for the good things. not looking at my eyes, looking at my flaws. at then my eyes, as consolation.</div><div><br /></div><div>checking to see if she read the message. if you saw the google photos.</div><div><br /></div><div>porches concert thurs super weird like i think i think really fucking with the crowd and at some point playing some gibberish tune. maybe this dude is just weird.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>10-30</div><div><br /></div><div>okay</div><div><br /></div><div>how when doing work project, i can think in modular components. but personal projects, it’s a mess. custom classes compile. i guess because code becomes part of the medium for design/exploration. when code is just implementation layer.</div><div><br /></div><div>today taking just a mere mere 1 puff. feeling a little frazzled/mind racing. not caffeine because - no coffee past two days (poops not as good).</div><div><br /></div><div>a salient thought today: being in boston (away from friends, people, culture, fomo) allows for self exploration.</div><div>(optimism). now with project. imagining also drawing classes.</div><div><br /></div><div>thinking of telling alisse i wish she was here now on the floor with me listening to grouper. thinking: take snap. # of selfie takes before sending = clear, concrete proof insecurity i think.</div><div><br /></div><div>i guess not so lonely lately somehow. </div><div><br /></div><div>suddenly emotional when listening to grouper. that sort of broad thinking mood. where anything becomes interesting. like recite a fact to myself about my occupation / lifestyle / status and the thought comes from the top layer — as a fact — and makes its way down slowly to next layer: what the fact means — and then down to me, slowly connecting to me. and this is powerful. like this very obvious fact is now powerful. my age. what i did today. what i ate. whatever. it’s fascinating.</div><div><br /></div><div>hm fight mood or go with mood. now, scattered, spilling css classes all over the place. go with mood.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>now when writing tagging thoughts</div><div><br /></div><div>things to share for therapy</div><div><br /></div><div>siavash: ‘reef taught me how to be comfortable with silence’.</div><div><br /></div><div>thinking of this thought parser description.</div><div><br /></div><div>today things like</div><div><ul><li><font style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Consolas;">wake up late (8am) and off to work</span></font></li><li><font style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Consolas;">work is work is good and stuff but still work and feels like work and not life lately.</span></font></li><li><font style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Consolas;">back home by 5pm. </span></font></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">workout. something lifty (prob should have done yoga)</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">shower, heat up food. order things online.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">work on project</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">lay down. lost in grouper.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">this is: the routine lately. lately being past two days but feeling longer. something similar last week, but up earlier.</span></li></ul></div><div><br /></div><div>unexpected perk of therapy: now, instead of talking to imaginary cute girls about my emotional problems (feeding ego), having imaginary conversations with therapist instead. </div><div><br /></div><div>11/2</div><div><br /></div><div>write that shit in your journal you fucking good boy</div><div><br /></div><div>11/4</div><div><br /></div><div>how do i feel about all caps in design? cop out.</div><div><br /></div><div>this visual design contest has been </div><div><br /></div><div>being strategic like i am hungover and capable of cooking so i should cook, that’s what i do with myself. actually no i am fine some tylenol and lingering in bed and a banana and jerking off and okay okay</div><div><br /></div><div>things i remember from last night party</div><div><ul><li><font style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Consolas;">being super slow to text alisse</span></font></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">a great greeting ‘omaar!!’ when walking in</span></li><li><font style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Consolas;">being really faded. 3 joints perhaps.</span></font></li><li><font style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Consolas;">teresa saying something like she appreciates me and loves me and feels close to me.</span></font></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">and later that we’re like the same person when i say adulthood = allowing yourself to put that joint away early on </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">having to take my shirt off during a drinking again and really drinking game overall. many truths or dares and opts out and people not drinking. the big dude who has done many sexual things.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">talking to lawton about metrosexual dude things (hannah in circle too) like piercings and stuff. and about kim being back.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">to hannah about routine life for a sec.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">m&amp;m peanut bars x2 and stop n shop cookie n chips</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">party not too party but smoking joint and coming out </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Consolas;">trisha a little insecure about

extra early and yoga before work</div><div><br /></div><div>these things</div><div><br /></div><div>glass of wine and woozy but happy and feeling music and sensations and body. do cardio more endorphins are amazing.</div><div><br /></div><div>guilt over forgetting to go w morgan to lunch</div><div><br /></div><div>in pitt now. long day. 4am wake up. 2:30 heavy heavy crash but maybe unhealthy lunch n sugar. </div><div>maybe i need to sleep less because work is intense.</div><div><br /></div><div>positive alisse things:</div><div>- i love you. nice long facetime saturday </div><div><br /></div><div>negative:</div><div>- imagining two months away. will you be okay?</div><div>- jealousy of other couples like kat and corbyn (per insta) who skype daily </div><div>- why doesn’t she miss me more?</div><div>- thanksgiving </div><div>- not getting text for few hours </div><div><br /></div><div>convo w lauren about nicks process</div><div><br /></div><div>do you feel obligated to order what waiter rec</div><div><br /></div><div>***the incentives ****</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>agreeing with chachi -- this is not about ego. in the car. both -- drunk. time ticking. zoned focus</div><div><br /></div><div>11-16</div><div>---</div><div>plane to la</div><div><br /></div><div>wednesday night. missing alisse. also: drunk. and negative thoughts brewing (now, switching from podcast to diiv. continue) like: when has alisse sacrificed for me? the thought circulating many times, no answer, deep reflection just a mounting resentment. and then thinking: beach house concert. okay. maybe there are others. maybe she hasn't had the opportunity. i don't know. open. ask about it. i've done my due diligence in decentralizing support system. a non drunk me would have said. but i guess: more communication i think would be better. a month is my threshold, and i start to feel a bit more detached. well this plus: working on work, and not my own projects.</div><div>anyway. being civil and good boy who goes to therapy, translating this blob of negativity -- or maybe, pulling apart one element of it -- and saying 'i miss you'. maybe some truth.</div><div><br /></div><div>wed morning. at coffee shop. crazy mocha. expecting hip, but not hip. and so working, adjusting to drab vibe. and waiter recommending i get a danish. and: clearly not wanting a danish, i just get it. because i asked what she recommended. i guess indecisive. but i knew i did not want that. </div><div><br /></div><div>wednesday night, earlier. out after design day.</div><div><br /></div><div>this idea brewing of more writing/digital art. or tools for writers to make writing more visual. these things. </div><div><br /></div><div>tuesday night. after design day with joe. leaving in the afternoon, crashing for a bit. more work. and then: a run. feeling *great*. to hotel bar for dinner. glass of wine. glass of wine enough to make me feel tipsy. salmon. and the jolly business man next to me, working on crash investigations (uber automated cars) for the government. off he goes, downstairs, for another beer. i read a little. a little more. tired but awake at night. the same thoughts as wednesday night. clarity in above description = mostly me repeating the more sober thoughts.</div><div><br /></div><div>i guess work and emails and product management is not super fulfilling. but i do want to create beautiful things.</div><div><br /></div><div>lately: afternoon crashes. maybe, go back to salads, morning gym, and later coffee start.</div><div><br /></div><div>lingering night conversations, work related. monday, (with lauren, dropping me off to honda dealer): nick's process. how he's expecting to constantly trim engineering estimates</div><div><br /></div><div>chachi i guess getting the full engineering goss and hearing how josh was an asshole to me. i really didn't take it that way. good at taking crticism (in work setting) -- to the point of obliviousness? or maybe not good at taking criticism but moreso seeing positivity in others' intentions. but actually he was kind of a process nut and overly strict and kind of a dick maybe now that i think of it. and did tell nick of things directly. but also seemed to be nice to me in a genuine way. i don't know.</div><div><br /></div><div>chachi and greg friends and know each other and each others' wives and all that but also seems like chachi has no respect for him as director. and like neither do others at rivers.</div><div><br /></div><div>sort of disappointed when hearing that, in middle of speech about we need proper structure (near mini fireplace outside meadery) talking about how we could use a ux designer and i'm like bitch i am the designer i can design i can do it all i am the full package. desperately wanting people to call my design dazzling and beautiful. but i guess getting that from stw team, user research, seeing how the product is holding up well.</div><div><br /></div><div>okay wait remembering this bit chachi and kim were talking about how they were like unsure about me and then kim is like 'i had the same realization' and something along the lines of how i'm a good guy or something.</div><div><br /></div><div>okay that conversation with chachi tuesday night. both of us drunk. him driving. one noticeable swerve. why did i get in the car with him? i mean, can recall previous night quite clearly. but: pulling up near the hotel. at a major intersection. emergency lights on. and telling me about his philosophy and how he wants to make referral the model project and he's open to criticism and like yo just tell me what you're thinking and call me out and i'm really not trying to be a dick and this is not about ego. variants of this.</div><div>sequence of drinks. at meadery. spiced wine. pretty good. then 131, upscale cocktail place with no vibes. there: hearing of hra deadline, burnout. and like framing my product-centric context. these engineers need a bonus or something. need to be better respected. how narrow nick's view is. how he made himself to be a vp but is sort of reckless.i mean in a subtle way. not wanting to be a leader. a purveyor of structure. but that's what he's supposed to be doing.</div><div>late at night: talking about women in engineering. kim mainly. and shocking how few women developers have interacted with.</div><div>i mean this whole visit interesting like being in this developer world. this new world. 3 days in the world though, too much. dragging me down. patience wearing down. wanting to escape.</div><div><br /></div><div>jon's perception of me. how i could have given a better impression in pitt. come in with a presence. but like. fleeting thought. i mean, letting thought flee because not caring enough.</div><div><br /></div><div>wednesday, thursday pushing the team to 'think abstractly'. breaking apart each action and whether it can be abstracted. feeling smart for this. and: really form/details easily abstracted. actions not really. we already have status change listener that writes to activtiy log and that seems good enough.</div><div><br /></div><div>wed late night / thurs morning. waking at 2am, vomiting and desperately trying to clear myself (a first, shameful way to end my streak), clean mouth of taste. but waking at 5:30, no hangover, and suprisingly productive. workout. to einstein bros. the same clouds from yesterday there. a 'healthy' bagel. off to work to kick things off. team not energized the way i want. and like is the form of thinking i'm leading to the right one? i think it is. but not taking enough command &amp; charge. and really they're being rude and a little unprofessional.</div><div><br /></div><div>pittsburgh, so damn cloudy.</div><div><br /></div><div>thursday delight: lunch with coco. his mama asking all about me and plans. hearing about the chem demo colin flew in for. curtis and gf recent move to portland. </div><div><br /></div><div>today: vietnamese coffee shop. getting a coffee, and later a chai latte. and thinking how i used to really juddge siavash for getting two espressos in one session at nine bar -- or maybe it was a matcha and an espresso - and now my restrctions on consumption so much lower. check yourself.</div><div><br /></div><div>okay switch and think about. now here la: alisse. this potluck. and alisse. and hearts.</div><div><br /></div><div>11-21</div><div>--</div><div>writing 4 therapy</div><div>recurring patterns of: balding (why even?). alisse not making me feel welcome fri night during potluck. and jealousy in diff ways. and that i have to be happy otherwise alisse has little tolerance for me. like: in the past, working through my issues. and now it seems deciding that my issues are prob not worth her time. floating over and over thinking of this.</div><div><br /></div><div>but i think something clear i can actually speak to alisse about:</div><ul><li>happy to be around your family</li><li>*not sure how i fit into your med school life*. it was important to me to feel welcome around your friends and i still don't feel that. do you talk about me with friends, etc? that it felt like i was reluctantly introduced as your bf.</li><li>that you've never mentioned that you want me to move here. that me moving involves planning and thinking of this, and in a weird place</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>la so far</div><ul><li>fri: potluck. </li><li>sat: vegas in morning. drive drive. at resort. alisse &amp; lisa offroad. rest of us: groceries. cook dinner, chill, sleep.</li><li>sun. zion. <br />night: i would like you to do more to show appreciation to my parents.</li><li>mon: bryce.</li><li>tues: zion: angel's landing. driving, night in vegas. a small outing: to fountains, and for boba. me, lisa, raccine.</li><li>wed: back to huntington.</li><li>thurs: thanksgiving. <br />night: watching insecure.</li><li>fri: wake and ?</li><li>sat:</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>11-24</div><div><br /></div><div>last night, bringing up the move to LA / wanting to hear thoughts. can we talk about this later? when later? i don't know. looking sad but</div><div><br /></div><div>the three points keeping me up at night. actually the full imagined convo here.</div><ul><li>centered around me. i want to move, soon. three places in mind: nyc, oakland, la. oakland + la = in state tuition and warmth. nyc + oakland = good support system. la = you. </li><li>bad things</li><ul><li>i don't feel like i can be vulnerable around you lately. feeling judgment rather than sympathy.</li><li>i don't feel welcomed into med school life (recalling friday mainly)</li><li>i haven't heard any excitement about moving here. it's all been driven by me.</li></ul><li>good things</li><ul><li> you've supported very well in the past. </li><li>you welcomed me into your family for the past week. </li><li>we really love each other and have a special relationship that i know i can't have with anyone else.</li></ul><li>if no response. would you care if i move to NYC? do you really want me in LA noting that there is some level of obligation.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>11-29</div><div>--</div><div>okay. so like recalling that list above - the 3 bad things over and over in mind - circulating further in brain, when, end of night, i ask alisse: 'can you let me know what thoughts are on moving?'. and her undecided. and me - honestly -- also probably undecided. like partly because questioning alisse's commitment. but. then i think about explaining that i'm in california to mama and baba. and the real barriers to being together long-term. and my weird dream of being with someone maybe more like me. like more spunky. or creative or something. and i combine these things and like 'really am i ready to move'.</div><div>but wanting to hear from alisse 'baby i want you i want you' something like that.</div><div><br /></div><div>and - night before leaving. not having sex. i guess having to wake up early and sleepy and stuff. and then also next day afternoon, before leaving, not ready to bang. except we did right before leaving. after talking about moving and stuff. alisse like ‘i definitely wanna be with you for the next year’. and saying</div><div>(i think commitment turns alisse on. at least commitment from me? or is it just her ego.)</div><div><br /></div><div>11-30</div><div>—</div><div>up after smoking and stuff last night and like ugh i really regret but no just pretending to really regret it because somehow i feel fine.</div><div>as always, tempted to chill when teresa is around. i think maybe not an attraction and i think maybe just loving her aura and how i feel around the group of people. idk.</div><div>anyway. last night meet up at cuchi cuchi. the tables with patterns. debate of: does it respond to touch. conclusion: yes, see sensors. brendan, teresa, trisha, betty. betty a badass cosmopolitan always hopping on flights. and like thinking of her and her existence and how she might have grown up to be such a confident and badass woman. don’t know her at all really. talking of: her trip mexico. brendan and crazy story doing door-to-door sales — solicited for sex once, another time — man abruptly asked if he wanted blowjob (realizing might be paying for underage sex, as he noticed teenager leaving before). hm pretty good laughter n times. t-wu parking car at my house. me having to pee but then chill session organically emerging in the dunge. roll one up — wait no one is already rolled — bring out the mini ice cream cones. talking i think about our upbringings / how teresa’s parents gave them lots of freedom and didn’t try to push them too hard in one direction. other things like: err i don’t remember. </div><div><br /></div><div>before bed looking at mirror and body and i like and then — high so positive mood — taking selfies — but also carrying the criticality of (my face) earlier — and kind of feeling ambivalent about face like i guess i can see how someone else likes it but me not so much.</div><div><br /></div><div>eating not one but two mini ice cream cones last night</div><div><br /></div><div>lately taking face/look anxieties a little far. thinking like of what i actually look like. what i truly look like. picking apart face shapes. ‘but how can i like myself if i don’t like myself?’. a: i don’t think i can?</div><div><br /></div><div>earlier drive back from work — late night, style guide / design meeting with nick at work — thinking about how i did not prepare that hard. and the earlier me who would have hustled so hard at this opportunity.</div><div>a lunch with amrit. always loving honesty. a real person.</div><div>lingering question = how do i ask to work remotely? </div><div><br /></div><div>12-1</div><div>—</div><div>now, new kaytranada album. pop not the right texture maybe for writing. but like. fuck throw something on. stuck in my head.</div><div>restless, mind running fast. unable to focus. starting to feel myself but like jerked off twice already today. too much screen. finishing swing time. the ending not really resonating. just kind of flat end. need to re-read / think about it.</div><div><br /></div><div>the tendency to want to look at a review. to read about other’s thoughts prior to processing on your own.</div><div><br /></div><div>things i need to do: meet up w a student from ucsb, meet up ucla. get on that media arts literature.</div><div>browsing the ucla dma student profiles like wha wha wha some made music videos for ash koosha and like so many features on news and stuff. a couple of seemingly normal creative people who worked creative corporate jobs.</div><div><br /></div><div>at forge today. getting there near 2. a chai latte. packed. a conversation near me: phd, part-time working cs guy (machine learning stuff), prob harvard, fresh out of 5 year relationship but not showing clear signs of vulnerability and weakness, and more quiet / nice woman who isn’t looking to offend anyone. the tone of people who know of each other — same circle — but maybe not super intimate / good friends on their own.</div><div><br /></div><div>getting to reef’s at 10. drinks and work, the intention, but drinks and talking the reality. reef tho, as usual, not restless. taking his time to pour the drinks (like a good 20 min in). and sipping so slowly. tangentially: how he doesn’t have current romantic prospect (for long time) but is totally good. i think, confident, loves himself in a super healthy and somehow humble way.</div><div><br /></div><div>okay the latest in thoughts on face. a thought stream for - about a year - in depth now. like a known and identified thought stream. and little progress. yes my face is long this is a fact. looking at pretty ucla dma candidate with clearly long face based on skeletal scan (project in which she printed her skull, had it recite things) — and she is beautiful. and then taking a quick selfie. face i think looks okay. it’s not great but okay is def good enough because there are other things to love. i just need a lovable face. now, revisiting photo booth video of me in bk that summer, making video for maliha’s bday.</div><div><br /></div><div>thinking about maliha today. </div><div>thinking about explaining my friendship with maliha to others. having this imaginary conversation with people who are maybe interested in my past about how like ‘no i wasn’t exactly a bro my best friend was a girl’ and i guess stroking ego through this perpetuation of subversive image even when skewed closer to the bro mainstream.</div><div>imagining her dying this is not not good</div><div><br /></div><div>earl album just a stream and riding it thank you for inviting me into your brain.

egyptair business lounge. exclusive wifi. okay. stop making fun of da homeland.</div><div>my arabic.</div><div>it's coming back.</div><div>from now on: only watch arabic shows. read arabic books.</div><div><br /></div><div>switching from: ultra comfy black pants to new stretch uniqlo jeans w/ drawstring (dream come tru). switching to contacts because face looks better like that.</div><div>cnn on the tv</div><div>some people addressing me in 3araby, others in english.</div><div>a sudden insecurity (stop using the word insecurity) about this.</div><div>listening to: buddy.</div><div><br /></div><div>okay alisse stuff. has been positive. and more love as she has more space (in hawaii, at home). positive things:</div><div>- calling me before flight. and just talking more frequently as she's home.</div><div>- on christmas 'wish you were here' for christmas dinner</div><div>- 'have a lovely flight. talk to u soon love'. love you with upside down smiley face.</div><div>- really happy i watched/enjoyed game of thrones</div><div>- 'ultimate cutie' after sending photo of boxers (which she requested)</div><div>- oh and the biggest: discussing work convo with nick about working remotely. how he was a little disappointed but also committed to supporting me / we'll make it work. not ideal for them. and alisse ackknowledging how i'm valued, and that's cool. and how she's happy that i'm prob moving to california.</div><div><br /></div><div>how relationship problems arise and dissipate internally. like: listening to esther perel. therapy session podcast. and evoking hard times with alisse.</div><div>somewhat set on moving to oakland. seems a lot more fun.</div><div>deciding to just care less about alisse and relationship. which creates a healthy distance. easy when i think of cultural barriers.</div><div>i'm glad alisse is like doing something prestigious b/c otherwise would be insecure about whether she's with me for my occupation and stuff.</div><div>a couple of 'second thought' thoughts about grad school because damn i can be ru ru running shit in arcadia. how i can clearly criticize nick / see what he's doing wrong.</div><div>i guess i would feel a lot of pressure too if alisse straight up moved for me. would i? </div><div><br /></div><div>maybe i should focus on my appearance in therapy</div><div><br /></div><div>here. now. realizations.</div><div><br /></div><div>a little rude / frustrated after flight delayed / no way to get to nyc on time. i mean - ditsy unhelpful assistant. but kind of short with everyone else too. not outright rude but a little short. that was not cool. regretting.</div><div>coming home and: passage to india. reading. finishing cm roadmap. game of thrones. talk to trisha. crash crash.</div><div><br /></div><div>more: feel good music because i wanna feel good.</div><div><br /></div><div>checking on rivers referral boards. keep. up 2 date.</div><div><br /></div><div>plagued by indecisiveness by packing. first show decision. vans + samba? samba + running shoe? no i need: samba + comfi running shoe. deciding to pick up cheap running shoe from nike outlet. get to store bam bam find the perfect shoe $35 yay cool i'm good i'm done i bounce. and then trying on while at home and it seems too small. can't win with me. shoe decisions. are the hardest decisions. actually the largest manifestation of indecisivenses.</div><div><br /></div><div>reading form + code on first flight and ugh god this book is so dope so many ideas about creating some sort of cm workflow map visual for himss.</div><div><br /></div><div>these jeans are the best to have happened me. successful shopping trip / proud of me. sweater jeans books boxers.</div><div><br

at best: observing closely, at worst: self-absorbed, floating.</div><div><br /></div><div>-12/28 fri: day tour x1 with tour guide nabil. old city area. large, well preserved. detailed columns. photos. sort of a scattered history lesson that is kind enough to imagine an older civilization. egoless society. dedications to a king, to a god. the only purpose. other palaces, tombs.</div><div><br

ride. deciding to enter. walking around. fixated on the people. hairstyles. facial structures. clothing. superficial examination taking me slightly to surface: to money, to lifestyle. that's all though, no imagning the type of person, the type of tendencies. looking for upside down house. separate ticket. spinny ride. extra ticket. putting it together: we only have tickets for zoo. so: ice

where you from. his friend saying they don’t really understand us. asking name multiple times. boys from fez. the more responsible friend shepherding wild one.</div><div>later, returning. from behind, walks towards me. i turn around, he stops. holds plastic bag out near the light. in a couple different poses, freezing. walk away, very very quickly, and back to hotel. buy a lighter. smoke in a nice alleyway - perfect amount of sketchiness, slight beauty. and then head back.</div><div>second spliff taking a toll. text alisse, then forget about it. in bed. vivid stories imagined. narrative quality degrading, turning into scattered images and then patterns. at some point, sleeping.</div><div><br /></div><div>1-12</div><div><br /></div><div>waking at 6am, brushing teeth, changing for dignity, then back up at 9. packing. breakfast. a lil disappointing but eggs appearing. urgency to poop, back to room. bath shower. pipe hits. looking for nug and concluding cleaner threw it

airport. some 7up. water. ps4 at waiting gate. meeting vietnamese guy studying business in the us. a senior. likes boston. but not college. interested in family business. selling rare stones. </div><div>and then vomit. big one. the feeling sudden and overwhelming. body hot. unavoidable, inevitable. deep breaths. i can make it to the bathroom. to the stall and: instant.</div><div>better now. and much better upon getting home, finally. 10pm. shower. </div><div><br /></div><div>1-15 </div><div><br /></div><div>now tues after travel. waking at 5. touching myself mainly as procrastination for waking up. stomach rumbling so a quick handful of granola. ride the sleepy thoughts, telling myself. kept up initially by resentment towards alisse for not properly facetiming me. on sunday pre flight, affection. we should FaceTime when you’re back home love. kissy face. habibi.</div><div>landing. comfort. shower, etc. in truth not really wanting to FaceTime, want to rest. but — me initiating the ft. talking to alisse and she is not present. planning on heading out but gives me a little call. seems tired. going to hang out with phoebe obligatorily. okay. good night. alisse sending a little heart before bed. like you think that can fix everything? this made me upset. i’m upset. need to prep for therapy soon. why don’t you ask me about my trip about the little details the little details i want you to want to little details i want your little details. i guess — not noting all the positive things alisse has said. weird how in long distance this is sort of data logging exercise: scroll through messages. that simple. also remember we talked more often when lisse was in hawaii.</div><div>also — rebook flight.</div><div>a theory that: writing upon waking is good time for brain to spill. so writing now. kind of ruining the rawness with big poo and nose blowing right now. but also - thinking through theory. makes sense. have not seen myself in mirror. less self awareness. in state of mind that is okay with choppiness. half a thought. a feeling. hm. let’s do this more. ruining this morning tho w practical thoughts of: when to go to work. when to pick up tailored pants, deposit money. siri: reminder to pick up dry cleaning.</div><div>now: naked. ejaculated. a quickie. kind of a chore really.</div><div><br /></div><div>the idea that i need to ‘process’ this break. kind of legitimate. of course — feelings and thoughts stemming from trip will slip into life. but also: life is different environment. without deliberate effort, things slip away. this amazing and radical experience compartmentalized. </div><div><br /></div><div>**</div><div>how i traveled with ahmed. regretting smoking. i mean: a little smoking good. kind of good to vaporize brain and have little background noise.</div><div>instagram break. check likes on photo. 21. who? peggy gou is hot. back 2 write.</div><div>processing and remembering is deliberate exercise</div><div>danger in narrativizing but also no processing, narrativizing, and memories disappear</div><div>**</div><div><br /></div><div>two * from now on for things that are noteworthy</div><div><br /></div><div>reading last night earl sweatshirt interview.</div><div><br /></div><div>yesterday work not really going as hard as i should but alas and whatever. a shout out from kristin in front of heather, meucci, gleeson, nick about how i’ve been great to work with, have special at translating disparate business requirements into something coherent.</div><div><br /></div><div>this morning i have a cough. i am coughing. </div><div><br /></div><div>need to do more writing exercises create more write more code more. do not go, do not go outside stay here.</div><div><br /></div><div>okay back to things with ahmed wondering if i was more passive because of our childhood. where i suppose he was more of leader. but also when he visited boston wasn’t like that. or just because high. i think awareness of this, plus sobriety towards end of trip pulling me out of it. i’ll make the orders. i’ll make the decisions. </div><div>being agreeable puts you in weird positions because yes sure i’ll do whatever but if we keep doing your whatever i guess i have no power so maybe i should have my own whatever thing. </div></en-note>]]></content><created>20190115T105424Z</created><updated>20190505T193926Z</updated><note-attributes><author>omarwnema@gmail.com</author><source>desktop.mac</source><reminder-order>0</reminder-order></note-attributes></note>
