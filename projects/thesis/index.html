            Spinal cord injury - affects 250,000 americans/year, and can cause devastating, irreversible motor deficit. Currently, there are no viable treatments for re-generating movement due to lost motor control. Epidural Electrical Stimulation (EES) of the spinal cord has shown to improve motor control in humans and animals with spinal cord injury.

          Creating a tool for EES simulation entails re-creating the spinal cord (physically and biologically) from scratch. As you might imagine, our end product does not come close in complexity to an actual primate spinal cord. It does however, provide a <span class="highlight-grey">functioning framework of an EES experiment</span>. Users can place an electrode in a physically-accurate spinal cord, run a simulation, and determine which motor fibers were recruited as a result of the virtual experiment.
          <br><br>
          We ensured that our computational model was <a href="https://github.com/penguinscontrol/Spinal-Cord-Modeling"  class="underline">well-documented</a> to allow for other researchers to use the model and build on it. As more EES experiments are conducted, our model will have more data to draw from, and become more accurate. Though the project is no longer in my hands, the Borton Lab has continued to develop and refine the model.

          We used three pieces of software to create a hybrid physical-neural model of the spinal cord.   After developing and validating a functional hybrid model, we worked to make our model modular and scalable.

          Current software can be used to create physics simulations, or neural simulations, but not both. We used MATLAB to mediate between a finite element model (physical model) constructed on COMSOL, and a neural model created on NEURON software.

          We tested our model by running simulations, and, simply, doing the math. Each 3D spinal cord component to be imported into COMSOL, a physics simulator, as a volume conductor. Our electrode, approximated as a surface current source, was placed in the epidural space to imitate EES experiments. (Later on, electrode placement was reduced to a simple parameter in MATLAB, allowing for quicker iteration in determining electrode placement).

          Our model matched mathematical predictions. The next step was to combine this physical model with a electrical model to simulate electrical stimulation.
          <span class="info-tooltip">The graph below bears a 1/r relationship of voltage, which resembles Maxwell's equations.  Given that current and conductivity (equation 1) are constant, distance from the source is responsible for the relationship shown. At the top center of the graph (dark area), the distance to the point source is lowest, and voltage is at a maximum). Anatomically, we see the same patterns that were demonstrated in real experiments: the highest concentration of current in the epidural space, with a large voltage drop-off in the CSF, and some current carried over into the dura.</span>

             Threshold, depolarization, repolarization, and refractory period phases are clearly shown. The motor neuron, pictured in orange, is recruited after the Ia fiber, which is expected given that the motor neuron is stimulated indirectly.

        Using MATLAB, we integrated our physical (finite element) and neural models. MATLAB scripts translated the physical model to discrete three dimensional point values with starting voltage values. These values are fed to the electrical simulation, and a series of changed voltage values is written back to MATLAB, and plotted.

        We wrote a MATLAB script to generate geometric points representing fibers in the spinal cord. This geometric axon was transposed onto the physical Finite Element model, where voltage values along nodes of the axon (corresponding to points along internode intervals).

            Our model matched the sigmoidal shape of a recruitment curve generated from actual EES experiments.
            <span class="info-tooltip">
              The graph below reveals typical characteristics of a recruitment curve that literature describes. The slope of this sigmoid shape is a result of our diameter distribution â€” larger diameter fibers are the first to be recruited, and smaller fibers are gradually recruited afterwards. We also see a flat-line preceding a certain threshold voltage, a positive slope where fibers start to reach threshold and elicit action potentials, and a peak value where all fibers are recruited.
