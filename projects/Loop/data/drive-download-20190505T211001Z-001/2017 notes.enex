<div>danny brown mood lately.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>afraid - truly afraid - to remove my coat, in what may be, actually, a lukewarm room.</div>
<div>(^ some sort of ‘insight’ in the morning)</div>
<div>working. like i suppose not that productively and quite slowly but maybe this shit takes a while? no just slow. ui not that resolved but like a skeleton that’s k rite. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>caught up, drawn in by danny brown’s music today. spurring strong thoughts and emotions. lyrics.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>feeling.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>true ego is watching yourself watch something and thinking about you should enjoy it.</div>
<div>getting fucked up. alone. many phone checks and no digital connections either.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>when am i going to do that like thought visual thing.</div>
<div>and this morning dominating thoughts is an imagined conversation in which i convey i should be an associate product manager and not a product analyst. institutionalized? </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>entertaining - aidan’s barista blog. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>new winter sounds: shoveling. snow, and how it absorbs sound. beautiful.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yes i’m drinking whiskey and smoking in my room late at night having not seen anyone this weekend. so what.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>super ADD danny brown, writing listening then like 5 minute ableton tim hacker danny brown (not) mixing and now, just listening, writing. </div>
<div>feeling just super existential lately.</div>
<div>lots of thoughts of like tanya maybe. weird.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking lots about mortality lately. makes me feel insignificant. like how how, once you’re sick. nothing matters. you accomplishments, life, becomes narrative.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<note><title>2017-01-13</title><content><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE en-note SYSTEM "http://xml.evernote.com/pub/enml2.dtd"><en-note><div>Repeating the phrase - overflow: auto in my head.</div><div><br /></div><div>wow 2 much coding one night up all night</div><div><br /></div><div>Too much self respect: One of those people who - does not just run to catch fleeting train, but runs toward the end, where he can find a seat.</div><div><br /></div><div>1/14</div><div><br /></div><div>‘i need to write i need to write’ culminating in - narrow corridor, laptop in front of me. simon’s shop. now and here: red, yellow, black walls. charming patterned ceiling. an edgy looking barista who doesn’t give eye contact. sleeveless pink shirt, flower tats, lip piercing. and a mild mannered one processing orders. a fellow long faced fellow. bookish, yellow sweater, round wired glasses. struggling to conjure her name - working with, starts with m, and pulling, making mental sounds to arrive at marls. business going on behind. here, calm, present. a cute girl, red beanie, head leaning against the wall. the chatter here is subdued. does not surround the space, oscillate in crazy waves. minor fluctuations, no piercings. the chatter. what’s the chatter of this place like?</div><div><br /></div><div>biking here, keith haring socks (=gloves) on my hand. first time in 1 month + biking. hard, good. things. thinking, while weaving through parking lot, slipping in through narrow gap between speed bump and parked cards: continue to challenge self physically mentally until i die. never be comfortable.</div><div><br /></div><div>leaving work &amp; usual, friday night, overcome by the urge to get fucked up</div><div><br /></div><div>siavash’s friend mike (born in hawaii, cali kid) coming in this morning to pick up bag. talking about his switch to 4-6 hours of sleep per night. usually 4.5. mama. seems amazing but like maybe his low has become him. and now, pointlessly googling ‘6 hours of sleep per night’.</div><div>last night. with pete and mike, for ramen. in davis. wayfarers, ball breakers. this joking demeanor where they sort of shake side to side and excude this fake confidence. hm. not one i’m familiar with, but combines other societal memes n themes i guess. talking about saudi &amp; oil compound life. and pete’s visit to royal family wedding in abu dhabi? wow. trying on siavash’s ring. not much formality in work interactions though i see. don’t feel the work veil/barrier. after, picking up alcohol / lingering in the store. thinking to late friday conversation at work (spurred by toast to jeff joining team). raving about a certain liquor store. interpreting this as wow you guys are proudly institutionalized. or maybe not. just love alcohol. but weird. drinking &amp; alcohol making me realize how people really like things mainly for cultural currency.</div><div>(and thinking - how quickly they moved jeff to product. or maybe this has been in discussion for a while, don’t really know.)</div><div><br /></div><div>comments in passing indicating siavash has talked about me - super nice. feels good. like pete: i hear you have quite the stretching routine. siavash: i think you need to get a book if you do it that much. era yes but that’s when it ceases to be relaxation and body exploration and another organized activity.</div><div><br /></div><div>have you done any adult extracurriculars / organized activities? asking the group at party yesterday. cute nora, .. guy - red head, round glasses, tall, soft spoken, and and girl..shorter, engaging face, bright eyes, doing nonprofit financial counseling after investment banking. er them. &lt; truly i’m not better than d-bags who just go to parties solely to hit on girls. nora, my height maybe. or our height. i like plural for us in this journal. it’s us right? the answer from nora: no. not really. sign up for something, then just end up surfing the internet. the others, same thing. </div><div>with the group, talking about</div><div>romance</div><div>arranged marriange</div><div>these topics these topics the modern topics</div><div>grandparents love story</div><div>talking to nora for..a long time. at least an hour. conversation a stream. at some point the other two in the group breaking off? or maybe her in the middle of a story i paid attention to? hm. i don’t really know. stories of: her time in china. skiing experiences. taking a crazy hill on ski bikes. making the jump and eating shit while celebrating. monster drinking half brother. arizona.</div><div>incredibly articulate. going into detailed stories that would seem self-indulgent if not well told &amp; actually relevant to the point we’re talking about. always explicitly related.</div><div>questions like</div><div>where do you see yourself? taking the question literally and answering mainly in terms of place. like how i don’t feel like i’m from somewhere. should have said my whole ‘home is a collection of experiences’ type thing. my experiences are scattered, and i can engage with pieces and it makes me feel great. </div><div>what are you 3 words to describe your essence?</div><div>what’s your narrative?</div><div>a pomegranate her answer. mine: divergent. how i’m lagging behind myself, making sense of streams of thought.</div><div>narrative is essentially collection of experiences</div><div>... this thread of conversation - the same one i’ve visited in depth with tanya, and touched on just once with adam. defining oneself. her explaining this whole collection of thoughts in elegant, concise way. like wow. her a level in the hierarchy above me and me above tanya. as in - me more clarity than tanya in this topic (her just starting to get into this train of thought) and her even more even more).</div><div>and like wow hey i super feel what you’re saying. sometimes when i agree i agree really really hard but then i say that i agree really hard and she doesn’t get that i agree really hard. but then maybe she got that i agreed really hard, saying ‘i feel like we’re on some shit’. or something like that, to communicate that we were really emotionally related and a fundamental and emotional level. or that’s what i think.</div><div>(next day, a text like - oo did i commit to basketball :/? and like no it’s chilling obviously was just flirting with you. can we hang out instead? she’s like yea sounds good! but like i only believe it if there’s a smiley face.)</div><div><br /></div><div>less notable things: pete and mike like super wanting to go hard in traditional sense. drinking monster, and - actually stopping uber on the way back to house to get red cups for beer pong. luckily, a ball not in the house, so no pong. just tunes instead, catering to crowd. siavash, as usual, ‘why haven’t you shown me this. like dude i can’t show everything. dvsn, i can vibe with that.</div><div><br /></div><div>a weird moment this morning when i’m running to the subway and just miss alewife, and i swear i swear someone from behind says ‘oo close’. and i turn around, smile, make a comment - but but it appears the two just talking to each other and i made up this comment and like headphones on, anyway, so would i have heard a comment? hint of crazy. just a hint.</div><div><br /></div><div>i’m ballin now..just like kobe</div><div><br /></div><div>now in a mood where everything i write is like yea of course i know that why am i writing that this is so silly because like it’s me and yes i know be more vague or artsy or something</div><div><br /></div><div>earlier (wednesday) shopping for boots and frye vs timberland who am i i’m timberland. deep at the time. the usual self interview questions maybe on a fake date or really just to appease ego or just because i’m lonely: what are your biggest fears? my answer now. becoming institutionalized. losing my culture. </div><div><br /></div><div>hey i feel weird about others touching my laptop now it’s so personal not sure why tho..</div><div><br /></div><div>last night maybe typing writing but like actually my hands are just tired.</div><div><br /></div><div>now in a mood in a rhythm where i can work weekends.</div><div><br /></div><div>talking to fam for a while. summer and hot air balloon, yousuf and new book. in depth with baba about promotion stuff, siavash walking in on conversation and feeling embarrassed because talking about money and things and uh i’m not corporate but actually i super am. </div></en-note>]]></content><created>20170113T173325Z</created><updated>20190407T180255Z</updated><note-attributes><source>mobile.iphone</source><reminder-order>0</reminder-order></note-attributes></note>
<note><title>2017-01-18</title><content><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE en-note SYSTEM "http://xml.evernote.com/pub/enml2.dtd"><en-note>At work.
	<div>Fresh monitors, courtesy of Franklin. Many thanks.</div>
	<div><br /></div>
	<div>Meetings all day and thinking thinking god I need people to take me seriously and ask my opinion so I can be a real ass product manager.</div>
	<div>Need to be taken seriously need to be taken seriously</div>
	<div><br /></div>
	<div>Today the perspective I carry that these people (leadership) not crazy geniuses but like just hear enough things and sort of choose things. Like roadmap somehow seeming straightforward to me. But really, know that's it's complex.</div>
	<div><br /></div>
	<div>Client dependency - sign off from clients to ask them to take a feature if we're delivering.</div>
	<div><br /></div>
	<div>How climbing hierarchy, initially, takes a lot of imagination and initiative. But later, by virtue of receiving exclusive info, you become the only person who can make decisions.</div>
	<div><br /></div>
	<div>Better each day at forcing myself to work at home / after work. Not much improvement in workplace productivity.</div>
	<div><br /></div>
	<div>Accidentally sitting in on meeting that's above my pay grade really..woops.</div>
	<div>What do people think of me?</div>
	<div>Actualizing visualizing the things I need to do to ascend.</div>
	<div><br /></div>
	<div>Visualizing a new design approach to working: putting out highly interactive prototypes for clients. Also: really no use for rivers agile? Just to have..</div>
	<div>--</div>
	<div><br /></div>
	<div>At home: productive working. Translating care plan to d3.</div>
	<div>Then vash back. Smoking, listening to his latest work. Dope fresh, good material for set. Criticism of, bring that delicate sound in after the guitar, not at the same time.</div>
	<div><br /></div>
	<div>1/20</div>
	<div><br /></div>
	<div>Inauguration Day</div>
	<div><br /></div>
	<div>Last night, clubbing as promised. Middlesex. Anthropological. Where nerds go to party. Some attractive people tho..</div>
	<div><br /></div>
	<div>Waking up today like gym or sleep? Gym, on 5 hour sleep.</div>
	<div>This morning gym. Shuffling through, but brain isn't scattered. Maybe just sort of apathetic. Feeling weird weird about body, out of shape etc and pains in shins and knees and also do I breath right maybe I should check all these things out.</div>
	<div><br /></div>
	<div>I like the train station.</div>
	<div><br /></div>
	<div>This conversation with nick about role playing over and over need to get it outta my head.</div>
	<div><br /></div>
	<div>Brain space focused on authority </div>
	<div><br /></div>
	<div>Last night s conversation with boys about: Adam deciding to do med school, and overall, how approaching life through lens of creating narrative is tricky.</div>
	<div>Oh and also holding on to good moments and really letting them carry into your life. Me and Adam both thinking about this. Adam: overall, a better, more optimistic outlook to ensure that med school apps go through.</div>
	<div><br /></div>
	<div>For breakfast mainly just peanut butter</div>
	<div><br /></div>
	<div>Is writing creating a narrative and is that a problem? I don't think so.</div>
	<div><br /></div>
	<div>Care plan card / ui through d3 </div>
	<div><br /></div>
	<div><br /></div>
	<div>First product analyst is data science to inform strategy in large scale companies</div>
	<div>Second is a market research role that overlaps. Includes writing requirements, meeting with stakeholders. Does not include any engineering interaction. Includes sales forecasts and monitoring of success. No design, just specs. Design and engineering. Resolve conflicts on cost and manufacturing. Go to pros analyst to make it clear.</div>
	<div>Different from what I'm doing, and a different career path. Monitor product and recommend changes to strategy. Keep product dev aligned </div>
	<div>Getting the intel, make rec. then monitor and continue to make recs. Third party role that is not incentivized in the same way product managers are.</div>
	<div>Training </div>
	<div>Internal argument:</div><div><br /></div><div>1/24</div><div><br /></div><div>Forfeiting work around 10. And smoking a small J with Adam vash. Mourning the us: plan for wall, new israeli settlements, Mexican wall, arts funding cut off..</div><div><br /></div><div>And then, how to breath, breath as the basic unit of life. Vash repeating the words of this yoga sassy old preacher dude. My feelings: half fascination, half skepticism, eye rolling - like ugh such a yogi meditator type. But ignore, focus on the words.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>1/28</div><div><br /></div><div>yesterday an uber everywhere type day</div><div>morning groggy smoking drinking things</div><div>diesel, in the working persons corner. bright lights. the curated grunge.</div><div><br /></div><div>hey this diesel coffee (4 dollar drip) actually good but still dbags</div><div><br /></div><div>lately the himss posters. a whole day to work alone. at some point, validation from gleeson and nick for liking my incredibly stupid poster. the radial explosion in lieu of simply stacked bars. only advantage: many points = interactive = narrative driven. can this be on my website? like. maybe maybe. showing siavash later and again, feeling incredibly stupid, like this was huge waste of time. but i guess visually an accomplishment. migrating bubbles and looking to start something new. what now what next i need to dominate.</div><div>what to work on now now want to start scraping at something new - back to the referral routes.</div><div><br /></div><div>at company party yesterday and it's weird and strange and draining me of energy. like running into greg and complimenting my tie and like how are you i know you're good so what the fuck do i say, erm did you leave the kids at home? or stupid fact based thing like how long you been here or spiffy or this is nice or something that all sucks. so i get a drink.</div><div><br /></div><div>talking (connecting too) you could say with kelly evans about this very thing - escaping (mentally, or situation) to get a drink. how she quit drinking for a year to be able to handle these situations.</div><div>deal with social anxiety. talking, socializing, with kelly who i don't know super well - about social anxiety. 'if only we could make a formal agreement that being quiet is not awkward, that we don't need to talk'. &amp; also, the dread of a conversation ending. how it's going to end. and of course, thinking all those things about this very conversation.</div><div><br /></div><div>interrupted my mike simon and wife. his wife, down to earth and engaging. but having to stay on treadmill of conversation, because, next to us, kelly and michael carrying conversation for a little while. going house hunting. me really going into the details about what they want in a house. everything everything, tell me everything.</div><div><br /></div><div>with a couple people - almaz maybe - bringing up how it's strange when the power hierarchy breaks down and flattens and a new hierarchy - yes hierarchy, largely - emerges. overlaps with the power hierarchy but not exactly the same.</div><div><br /></div><div>sean caroll taking me aside and thanking me, saying, i hear you're doing a terrific job. me, it's so easy and natural because like my coworkers are inspiring n things. how i have a great opportunity. me asking how he comes up with speeches. giving a long answer. that's like coherent but too long but still engaging and hm this how you became a ceo i see.</div><div><br /></div><div>other things: sports (drew with patriots tat?), gluten free diets. how are you how are me who you living with things. and people there all being wifed up.</div><div><br /></div><div>hospice enrollment. and quality of life? interactives. large data set exploration or story.</div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">fears = convo ending, institutionalization</span></div><div><br /></div><div>oh and this onesie party - showing up in a suit that's kind of a onesie right? snacking, when promptly taken away, fitted with trash bag, and booed by large crowd of white people. </div><div><br /></div><div>immigration ban this stuff is real</div><div><br /></div>

imprecise and creative. independent. super grungy. or just sloppy. don't know don't know .. spur thoughts on the necessity (sort of) of being judgmental in the workplace (humans as resources, needing to organize quickly and effectively). and, tangentially, me getting some respect in a detached work sort of way (for generating ideas, giving creative input)</div><div><br/></div><div>tense meetings at work with engineers not getting requirements and like aw i have to build all this. and feeling for them because here PMs come in and like yo this is what we doing and very little context delivered. i mean the engineers super lame and risk averse - but not feeling what they're making is theirs. it's just a task that is handed down. but it doesn't matter if this part of the job is done poorly. doesn't matter if you don't response to emails from lower people. only the people who have exposure - focus on them to ascend. that's how it works.</div><div><br/></div><div>saliently (a real word? cool) also this melding of work and life. related: this new flex vacation policy. in some ways nice because it breaks the barrier of talking work. i mean obvious. but the barrier doesn't exist. it's just life. with jon, nick, tyler sheffels (three white dudes, three white names) talking of things and various things but lots of software too. but the tone is like..like adventurous. rogue. </div><div>many let me tell you a story type stories and they're good versions of those but nonetheless those but i guess how else do you socialize.</div><div>universal values of the hustle and grind and working all night and weird hours and being rebellious in nerdy way.</div><div>and like also a lil shit talking (this doesn't leave the room, jon as a disclaimer to nick and me, but really just me) tark feeding a bunch of baby birds. and hey i guess that's accurate. and then trying to pin down the panties left in office room.</div><div><br/></div><div>getting widdit to be successful vs being myself, retaining dignity, hustling hard. </div><div><br/></div><div>ego enjoying the hangout and kind of nice but on the way out missing a handshake and hearing laughter but actually no laughter i think (echoing acid trip) and a feeling of shrinking, the world around me looking down and being condescending.</div><div><br/></div><div>thursday in all night working working (waking at 5 and in house all day). going to grocery store to get out (of mind, but unable to escape productivity bent) and thinking of how this is too easy &amp; too routine. too easy. and panicking, slightly. when will i leave this city maan..</div><div><br/></div><div>chatter god such an amazing sound. because can tune in endlessly, oscillation rhythmic but unpredictable.</div><div><br/></div><div>hey so i write sloppily and it makes no sense and points are often delegated to parentheses but then i look at polygraph.cool (name cringe) and visual essays, how beautifully they meld and convey points and step back and look at communication from a ground-up way. maybe i'm suited to this new age writing, new age thinking.</div><div><br/></div><div>the things that make me me and that i like about me make happiness unsustainable. you i know i know you know.</div><div><br/></div><div>a cab ride with teacher (who got degree in finance from sloan but never went back). talking about his students - super super poor population, some living with just distant family members or just alone. and making it. most into college. his routine, saving for travel, ubering on weekends. </div><div><br/></div><div>hm so the data visual personality art project i guess will have sort of a focus.. like first just conveying the lists in a weird scattered format. but the this bit of thinking of people as collection of data points. how this is beautiful, less judgmental, and more accurate. constantly confronting content. idk. there's something here.</div><div><br/></div><div>lately thinking about poetry so i guess i need to read poetry.</div><div><br/></div><div>a tinder line of 'one polite motherfucker'</div><div><br/></div><div>thoughts of leaving and going to grad school for design and digital media / data viz because god damn i wanna develop cool shit. or being a data journalist.</div><div>a creative rejuvenation this weekend. maybe get my name on a big publication, get some traction so i can start freelancing.</div><div><br/></div><div>woo phew pew</div><div><br/></div><div>talking to libby but not being curious enough about her and listening enough. </div><div><br/></div><div>mama, cute card from students. drawing her as ninja princess. brilliant. </div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>2/8</div><div><br/></div><div>i have a state of mind so i should capture</div><div>tho</div><div>escaping is the goal right now. finding myself capturing instead. somehow, working all day. and accomplishing..very little tangible.</div><div>today like sort of horny all day since coming home and restless restless all day just so restless allowing for thought loops not unfocused just restless, cannot be appeased entertained must move move change change </div><div><br/></div><div>so many fantasies with norah what am i doing to myself</div><div><br/></div><div>a long day a small joint</div><div><br/></div><div>really cannot stop touching self</div><div><br/></div><div>oh right weekend at norah’s great like so refreshing</div><div><br/></div><div>reading h is for hawk and acclimating</div><div><br/></div><div>where am i am i exiting lately</div><div>yes i am</div><div><br/></div><div>thinking about perception of myself at work</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>2/11</div><div><br/></div><div>Right thought at the wrong tim</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></en-note>

<en-note><div>Sparked by writing date:</div><div>Time passing, quarter of year. Need to be dazzling doing more at work. </div><div><br/></div><div>A morning of: stomachache from a bite of free bevita from gym, re-running stored procedure. Sunlight entering room, mind.</div><div><br/></div><div>The people, the usual characters on the bus.</div><div>A glance or two at the daily steps.</div><div><br/></div><div>Calling Kareem yesterday, post break-up. The age of 28, a sort of deadline for starting wife search. And how, in the meantime, a conflict between enjoying life, singlehood, or preparing to be marriage material. Being mature, good Muslim, good habits, etc. Breaking down the latter as a fallacy sort of - setting concrete plans and behaviors to follow will not necessarily shape you into the person you want to be. Forces are complex, and difficult to control. (Not dwelling on this point for long enough). More to think about here..<span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">A rational, Colin approach to the break-up overall. I need to move on.</span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">Bits: my dating life, breaking Metwalli curse with a girl, dental school//dental life, the job job Orlando and how it's been. And more romance: how you can adapt and grow to love someone. Kareem's opinion - an important one that I agree with. --Kareem picturing a magical walk (commenting on bunnies, creatures barking) when in fact walking in the area.</span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">Taking conversation with me home. Siavash surprised to hear my opinion of: marriage deadline(ish) in 9 years, strong preference for Arab or Muslim. Like super surprised.</span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">At work a week of coffee. Lower energy</span></div><div><br/></div><div>--</div><div><br/></div><div>3/4</div><div><br/></div><div>immediate things</div><div>the tall barista from nine bar, migrating here to simon’s. first week on job. overhearing conversations with her and other cute, small barista. ‘where are you from’ developing into a sincere, distracted conversation. something about moving from a beach town, here being different..</div><div><br/></div><div>(oh and other people, like guy wearing running shoes, knee-ripped jeans, glasses, and fitted skull shirt. the other barista, with my glasses, clean-cut haircut, and a couple piercings. asymmetric, a long, almost tribal piercing on his right ear. my judgments of him: a rebranded dork. or maybe always coolish edgy i don’t know. two snippets of conversation: friend doing pop art under weird moniker, and tattoo shops).</div><div><br/></div><div>then, nine bar woman with male barista. talking about barista competitions. ‘nobody is gonna care about you if you win’. how job at coffee shop is not going to push theoretical friend who wants to be best of best barista to be best barista. need to go out own. do research. buy own equipment. experiment. hm. craft in everything, craft in everything. 1 hour passes, conversation more personal. tatted guy talking about his lesbian parents. </div><div>tattoos: casey’s recent addition. contrasting further. sort of square and abstract, dotty. huh.</div><div><br/></div><div>in the cab ride. (yes an uber to a coffee shop on a weekend, my time is valuable my time is important). for the second time - a ‘creative’. or rather someone carving a creative career. the first, black dude with children, maybe 30 years old. cool / hard-working. days of hustling in construction. making good money (calculating, roughly 70k). living the life, taking vacation to florida on weekend etc etc. then injury, more work. to school, coming out working as medical tech. thinking of becoming surgical tech like sister but opting out. now, driving uber and trying to get into film? wants to make a film about..himself? or his community? desire to trace, concretely, his reasons for living his life the way he does. and to me - this is confusing. why? that’s not how your life worked? but the more dominant sentiment: how narcissistic, self-important. why would anyone want to hear you feel you this much?</div><div>and this cab driver, today, talking about interest in creating a ‘personal brand’. 22, fresh grad, having contributed little to the world (quick search revealing he went to business school at bentley). wants to ‘talk to the youth’. ‘like i could talk to 30 year olds or whatever but really i’m trying to talk to younger people’. his story - or the one conveyed to me - about fuck that i ain’t gonna do a job i hate so like i do my own thing i tour manage and i’m gonna make a podcast and tell stories (because my story is important). respect for going out on own, doing own thing, but disdain for self-importance. realizing how baba, mama, have similar view, but greater magnitude. see me as self-important for wanting to explore and do weird things and not just be fucking thankful and realistic. okay. not entirely related. but attracted, intellectually to the idea that someone is judging me with the same exact sentiment with which i’m judging someone else. </div><div>confident that ‘this is just a start, that podcast will get bigger’. and now now instead of writing judging, should probably listen to podcast and re-calibrate viewpoint.</div><div><br/></div><div>coffee oozing swimming in my body. (and later, not, somehow body not processing coffee as expected after this break..)</div><div><br/></div><div>remembering concrete vivid details of cab rides, last time in this same spot same coffee shop and feeling less bad about memory and smoking and not being able to remember various details about <a dir="ltr"/><a dir="ltr">flaming lips</a> concert after <a dir="ltr"/><a dir="ltr">flaming lips</a> concert. like casey recalling each arrangement of inflatable balloon installations per song and me like hey why was i not able to recall that. </div><div>maybe too stoned? didm’t think so, but the concert drifting. the music kind of drowning out. the right sonic frequencies. but thrown out almost arbitrarily. i don’t know. cannot connect. mutterings of ‘best concert ever’ &amp; accolades from audience, after 1) band member riding on unicorn around crowd and 2) band member in bubble around crowd. and like not singing because logistics and practicality but still skeptical like why not just sing and play music and not throw this generative art in my face. generative - swapping out installations of three giant inflatable animal band. the fish dancing well, others just ambivalently bobbing. and then balloons and confetti everywhere everywhere. gratuitous and condescending? the band members telling stories that somehow making me cringe slightly (is there lighter word from slight cringe? even slight cringe too dismissive). oh and giant dancing eyeballs. and of course the streaming lights / projects up top. everything psychedelic colors. neon. like hey i know you know i smoke and like psychedelic music but stop this? or do it? because co-opting the general population like everyone else..</div><div>(with this concert and latest <a dir="ltr"/><a dir="ltr">dirty projectors</a> cannot judgment in group of uniformly white people..)</div><div><br/></div><div>okay more events and things because forgetting where i am and what i’m doing. practice abstraction later.</div><div><br/></div><div>thinking like maybe i’ll see more beauty in my life if i have all the data and visualize and see patterns. a way of confronting the issue of not being able to internalize beauty from previous days. amazing weekends, drowned and faded in routine of the next day.</div><div><br/></div><div>phone conversations. 1x with may. i don’t know dating and whatever things and dental school. and vacation planning. and tanya, longer, more extensive. calling me monday after terse conversation sunday. like just a few minutes. not wanting to talk, really. short. a quick complaint. half-listening, half-talking to me. me as conversational entity, okay, normal. but leaving conversation not resentful at tanya but at self and like ugh wow no one wants to talk to me. no. isolate. but how could i have made this judgement at the moment and not in retrospect? by giving self the benefit of doubt..dangerous territory. </div><div>and call with kareem. wrote about this.</div><div><br/></div><div>there’s a way to talk about work that’s interesting - in relation to your emotions and self-development. and observations in hierarchy and extrapolation to the world. personalization and extrapolation.</div><div><br/></div><div>oh like life change things </div><div>—&gt; spend more time producing. less time doing errands and things. like cook in bulk. make gym more purposeful. listen to dope shit in the morning. or fucking read and zone in immediately. breakfast, pre-made. just doing it.</div><div>—&gt; i suppose mostly just above. but like design projects and work and being creative as a priority. creativity above all. above all.</div><div>—&gt; restraint all the time. eating the right things, forcing self to work and stay awake. </div><div>-&gt; no shame in doing productive things like work a little in between chilling because this doesn’t break mental zone? at least test..</div><div>(illustrator and coding, design books, remade breakfast, a new relationship with coffee)</div><div><br/></div><div>a dominant thought space of trying to understand small topic deeply by (sort of unintuitively) processing knowledge in a broad area of topics. developing the ability to see patterns at multi-disciplinary scale, and applying to small scale. i think that’s coherent. or maybe not, maybe small scale patterns and depth better, more direct.</div><div><br/></div><div>headspace today less thinking and introspecting and more head bobbing to podcasts and nas and <a dir="ltr"/><a dir="ltr">jay-z</a> and contemplating the question of nas or <a dir="ltr"/><a dir="ltr">jay-z</a> that one-liner on bumble posed.</div><div><br/></div><div>oh the town hall meeting this week. in baptist community church. small room with many foldable chairs. mainly older local somerville crowd. white. cannot get that this meeting is exercise in abstraction. all the questions missing this point, resulting in answer that explains this principle. bearded urban designer (working for city) effortlessly explaining basic environmental psychology / urban design. ratios of street width to building height. feeling enclosed (a part of something) but not claustrophobic. building mass, focus of the day. techniques of setback and division. voting with dots, talking to angela about urban planning projects for <a dir="ltr"/><a dir="ltr">davis square</a> (graphical building codes), some suburb looking to rip out railroad and add bike path type thing, and some main commercial street in a different town. super rad. lost in listening. </div><div><br/></div><div>last weekend. friday with vira &amp; friends. banter mostly. two white dudes, one who had lives in 52 john. cute half japanese girl (dating one guy). all working with matthew? running into eric at brewery (nice space, beer, grilled cheese and mac and cheese only). rooftop. hunching as it gets colder. coming back, chatting chilling with adam and siavash. </div><div>next day - out and about. balling with eric and casey. 14 year old joining. no smiles. trash talking, draining jumper after telling me ‘i need to work on my defense’. tude.</div><div>then, at angela’s. older crowd mainly.</div><div>after - going out with nora, ryan, allie. boston bar, chinatown. then zuzu. hey just three of us. awkward but heartwarming dancing through soul night.</div><div><br/></div><div>week before himss brain drain.</div><div>before before. <a dir="ltr"/><a dir="ltr">friday night</a> staying in (work) and then saturday at <a dir="ltr"/><a dir="ltr">cuchi cuchi</a>.</div><div>okay double before. double before. oh right. friday working a little i think. and then saturday more work (early early) then pray, protesting, brunching. and later - brett.</div><div><br/></div><div>actually factually not just a phrase i say in my head, one that i say ‘all the time’ according to casey. not aware. but i guess nice, liking the mystery, distance from self. dinner with casey and the good things happening lately: winning entreneurship contest at work (creating body camera), admission at harvard with room to negotiate part-time status. ‘playing the game and winning’ type things. okay. good good. </div><div><br/></div><div>i guess i’m sort of afraid of too much clarity. </div><div><br/></div><div>himss in some words. </div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>3/11</div><div><br/></div><div>standing in line at forge. a tea for casey, sweet for the table. 4:30-ish. two in front of me in line. slow, trickling out. well whatever context here not helping in paint the feeling - the feeling being wow it’s so great to be alive. ah. all these things i want to do and learn. and people to meet and experiences and ah energy i need to spread and absorb. this week like this, how can i make every week like this?</div><div>i’m feeling alive - feeling alive right now - but what was it that i was feeling earlier? gaps of vibrancy punctuating an overall reluctant productivity, complacency. purpose coming in bits and pieces.</div><div><br/></div><div>(just now, rejecting siavash’s proposal to sit in my room and work. stripping jacket, immediately opening my sliding door. and a sort of internal recoil. not sure why. feeling bad after saying no. and now feeling like i need to really take advantage of this solitude..write something rich)</div><div><br/></div><div>most recently, at forge with casey and vash. alternately standing and sitting and gesturing and joking. casey retelling story of corporate maneuvers, at work winning contest, also negotiating grad school enrollment.</div><div>conversation and chilling spilling over from the morning with siavash. initially yoga. and then, feeling great and light. in kitchen but not hungry. siavash flattening oats on a plate so that it can slightly harden (skeptical but in fact it happened). telling story of davis square town hall meeting, recent chilling at angela’s (japanese food // book club). </div><div><br/></div><div>h is for hawk a beautiful book actually.</div><div><br/></div><div>the day feeling like a stream, a wonderful stream. how weekends like this are incredibly fulfilling, and yet get washed away, overpowered by routine. </div><div><br/></div><div>uber rides lately rich experiences by projection. like the conversations short slices, but opening space for imagining a new person</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>recent uber rides</div><div>entrepreneur uber</div><div>radio producer</div><div>egyptian</div><div>lebanese businessman</div><div><br/></div><div>--</div><div><br/></div><div>willpower this week and pushing through things</div><div>verve in workouts</div><div>and at work</div><div>and yet restless manifesting itself</div><div><br/></div><div>to siavash about this</div><div>swages ness date</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday, breaking down productivity and time. trimming the fat in day. the conversation veering from emotional &amp; psychological (are there untended needs that will also be there, that i must confront) to practical (shakes for breakfast, no doodling, less cooking, reading on the bus etc etc). expanding growing, living in the abstract, the concrete invited for portions of conversation. as is typical.</div><div><br/></div><div>--</div><div><br/></div><div>conviction to get a car (and inherently deciding that my emotional well-being is better than growth, confrontation of normal ass people living lives). that part okay. being sedentary though, major reservations.</div><div><br/></div><div>sunday coming home <a dir="ltr"/><a dir="ltr">at 5:30</a> and like i need to get shit done so high powered doing virtual errands ordering things and banks and taxes and reimbursements and communications to family. and like this is me i get things done. (bad for me?)</div><div><br/></div><div>--</div><div><br/></div><div>meeting nadine <a dir="ltr"/><a dir="ltr">3pm</a> at crema. okay. let’s slow down.</div><div>thinking lately need to make writing more. expansively. or. no. keep fragments and style. but - explore an experience through writing. like how helen macdonald, h is for hawk, takes waking up. stretches it. generalizes first, draws vivid analogy. then, slowly into brain state. zooming into thoughts. maybe not now but do this.</div><div>at crema at crema. purposefully meandering into spot. the last empty table, upstairs. depositing belongings. removing jacket because i look cooler with light new olive bomber type coat (but damn too many green pieces of outerwear). configuration of self. book in hand? read book for couple minutes, or phone? or stand, because aware on arrival. ultimately, aesthetic, stylistic choices. none productive. caught in this mental space as nadine walks in. giant north face. a strange, short of frilly pants towards the bottom. unexpected. nadine looking largely the same, if a bit skinnier. immediately to the counter to order. separately, i infer. coffee and brittle cookie, sandwich for nadine.</div><div><br/></div><div>beginning of social encounter. comfortable, i suppose. best case scenario - awkwardness, anxiety, solely manifesting itself in unnecessary social movements. (because channeling the same comfort from years ago). </div><div><br/></div><div>one way of writing about experience - list absolutely everything remembered then filter and curate?</div><div><br/></div><div>… oh shit <a dir="ltr"/><a dir="ltr">9pm</a> JDs show should i go? new - absolutely new friends.</div><div><br/></div><div>3/13</div><div><br/></div><div>overcoming writing inertia.</div><div>um just being practical.</div><div>experiments in productivity and practicality</div><div>ugh.</div><div><br/></div><div>finished h is for hawk. yay. on the bus. because i can focus, zone in on the bus.</div><div>today assessing my mental state frequently. like: how do i feel?</div><div>i mean more productive and not eating chocolate but still restless and needing to leave work at 6.</div><div>and then suddenly sort of braindead like around 8.</div><div>goal is to last until 9 for working. like work at work 8 hours then work at home 2-3. that’s the goal. okay?</div><div><br/></div><div>but today. finished packaging up bidco reports. put some thought into involution engagement. responding to updated specs. meetings: stand-up + triage + config + platform req = 2.75. and then lunch. and also leaving <a dir="ltr"/><a dir="ltr">4:30</a>. really like 4 hours productive time at work. making new mockup at home. is this enough for one day? no no no.</div><div><br/></div><div>tomorrow: BIDCO issues for 2 hours. 4.13 documentation. lots and lots of care management work.</div><div><br/></div><div>waking up and meditating the first thing in the morning. doesn’t really wake me up, just a sort of patience. out of the danny brown state. not quite in the ambient state tho.</div><div><br/></div><div>not really present, just constantly re-orienting. that’s okay though right?</div><div><br/></div><div>master the art of the second wind. exercise? hardcore music -&gt; work session. okay. that’s something. meditation? haven’t tried that one. lunch dinner reversal a good move in this regard though.</div><div><br/></div><div>wow productivity dominating the brain who would have thought.</div><div><br/></div><div>&amp; deciding - dev, design and music outside of work. </div><div>hey being in boston not so bad because i can be productive and have no friends and build up self-esteem that way?</div><div>--</div><div><br/></div><div>summer summer happy bday. her day. friends over for birthday on weekend. but today: brownies, singing happy bday. talking, of course, about harry potter. the latest play will be made a movie. 3 more books to come. and then brainstorming ideas for go pro. telling her to get editing software.</div><div><br/></div><div>..yousuf doing poorly in school need to need to do something about this.</div><div><br/></div><div>--</div><div>tenniscoats, this new japanese band angela has shown me. liking them &amp; resisting the urge to look up reviews. because - yes, pitchfork is validating.</div><div><br/></div><div>--</div><div>how can i write about not me?</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>3/24</div><div><br/></div><div>Things slipping. The backlog of creative ideas. When when do I work on this? 1 day/week, at least, need to carve out time. Carve out. Corporate speak. This phrase okay.</div><div><br/></div><div>Routine experimentation. Heh. Matcha vegan shake. Not bad bad.</div><div><br/></div><div>At home, post work. Cooking. Working a tiny bit. Like 9ish, maybe just read n sleep lots. Maybe 5 pages of text weaving through 30 or so min of wandering. Oof. Knowing what I need to do..sit up. Stretch. Things. Next time. Do things. Need the second wind before bed.

responsibility and life awaiting and me forming into just me but not this other great thing and so need to rush push do everything be productive. enjoyment ancillary.</div><div>&amp; AND others. time is passing and i haven’t taken this design course or done grand visualization or produced weird journal art so here i am, static. or. not static, but ascending in some directions. the sum oh ascension not producing the person i envision. </div><div>musical complacence = natural brain pattern = future, danny brown.</div><div>some skepticism over the value and meaning of art. i mean i don’t really understand art, the art world, art history. but - wariness over creative entitlement, the idea that ~you~ are important. you are, most likely, not important. </div><div>sleeping naked and totally cool with it.</div><div>approaching social settings in deliberate way that isn’t ‘selling out’. or maybe, underlying pinpointing more precisely what selling out is. verdict on this feeling unclear: that i need to work on myself, do interesting things in the span day, week, partly to have something to talk about. in-genuine (not a word apparently) but necessary?</div><div>this feeling that everything we do is just fodder for conversation.</div><div>phrases that echo, recur in head, like ‘math, english’ (still carrying from school days), ‘what am i doing wrong’. ah this whole stream of like explaining or having conversations with other people but still in my head, like i invited people into brain. this is a pattern, with concrete words that emerge. maybe not so accessible now.</div><div>trying to imagine comfortable silence with new, nameless faceless, romantic lover. and difficult.</div><div>imagining myself more handsome, face less long. </div><div>-</div><div>fantasies of someone close dying. the news revealed as i’m with replaceable pretty manic pixie dream girl type. i leave, without explanation (replying, months later). ends here.</div><div>entire family dying. story does not linger on emotions, broader step back. becoming character in a store, resolved to find meaning in life. ends here? </div><div>sister dying, brother dying, mother committing suicide.</div><div>fucked up, i’m fucked up.</div><div>-</div><div>ah so structured 2 much structure stop get the structure away from me.</div><div>friday nights. sleeping, 1 or so am. not smoking, partly health, productivity concerns, partly path of least resistance. a plan for saturday being explored. </div><div>realizing that maybe i can adopt the habits &amp; patterns of successful people and maybe (maybe) join their ranks. underlying - understanding the habits of successful people. where to cut day. how to structure the right amount of happiness, sanity. not sold tho, still resining to moderate success, spunk, quirk, flaws carrying through.</div><div>what is it about siavash’s mood/thoughts/opinions that is..stormy - infiltrating into others, into outside environment.</div><div>oh it’s april and summer is coming and i need to make some dope digital shit before then - so so, i guess, then, sundays are for work.</div><div>aesthetics are not shallow, just a form of mental exercise? art too. </div><div>getting better at better at not needing external validation and no siavash no thank you i did not need to meditate but okay maybe the fundamental problem still exists in me.</div><div>fear of: steering conversation somewhat deliberately with standard questions. kind of thinking - can we just agree to get fucked up? but i guess that’s not the mood.</div><div><br/></div><div>hanging with ingrid (down to meet, it turns out?) last weekend. going on about home and maybe talking about myself too much..and talking a little about work. steering conversation somewhat deliberately with standard questions. but i guess otherwise a nice time, leaving on note to meet up again?</div><div><br/></div><div>face too long. conclusion from photos.</div><div><br/></div><div>working with involution - cute cute sharon and awkward awkward me.</div><div><br/></div><div>i will wear glasses today i will wear them and rock them and feel good in them.</div><div>unsure of how i feel about pinkish shirt with bleaches, knee-patch jeans. too much fade? black jacket contrasting too much?</div><div><br/></div><div>with nora, first getting tea at tatte. set amount of time until may arrives. me, sort of upbeat. external momentum (word for this, better description?). talking about previous date at the cafe. and nora’s friend, with her first, second, third date outfits pre-selected. nora taking the advice, working out well for her. hey i guess we’re friends now that we’ve talked about this..but onto bookstore super wandering and then outside, a focused conversation before saying goodbye. state of activism and america, though melded with personal experience. pausing as girl nearby cries intensely (friend hugging, tending to her)..</div><div><br/></div><div>&amp; last sunday, dinner with adam’s parents. </div><div><br/></div><div>asma’s husband released.</div><div><br/></div><div>drawing inspiration from the (white) people at diesel. a representative crowd. backgammon, meticulous notetakeing. some dope sketches nearby.</div><div>sketches - learn to draw? can i learn to draw? yes. try. b/c if i fail then i can’t draw and whatever because i’m still creative.</div><div>so maybe like work 10 hours / day and and in the small spare time, after finishing this book, try drawing?</div><div><br/></div><div>body composition a mark of insecurity. now, a bit bigger, less skinny. hyper - obsessively ripped =</div><div><br/></div><div>music lately considering delving more into amateurism. fuck the polish. leave the oil from the hair. monospace fonts. etc. okay i’m consistent..</div><div><br/></div><div>the saga of delio - calling during work and asking if i’m running for alderman? no. </div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday, reef’s performance. motley saudis - zainah, very hot bahraini friend, nadine, robert everyzadeh (pro golfer in vegas?)’s sister. okay this is cool - and maybe ostensibly weird but not actually weird - but hey now these lebanese girl accents are like kind of attractive and endearing.</div><div>walking in, side by side with nadine, finding, zoning in on spot, and noticing, after commitment, siavash, adam, lily splitting off. a very minor, inconsequential ‘oh no it’s too late’ sort of moment. anyway. side by side with nadine. her, attentive. me as well. comments and laughter exchanged here and there.</div><div><br/></div><div>a couple, sharing headphones, sharing at computer screen. guy’s hand gestures not quite designing.</div><div>noticing, a lone desk upstairs. wonderful.</div><div>conversation between pierced, lightly bearded dude and woman across. walking in, serious, tense. now, relaxed. like - more than 45 min passed, years - the dynamic switching from awkward first date or maybe work partner to just the usual. easing into things.</div><div>guy bringing scone, coffee to girl. a slow &amp; genuine, movie-like smile. titled heads staring at the phone, lightly laughing. </div><div>a date, of some sort. continuity in the conversation, but not more than a few prior encounters (still learning about family structure). the woman, sort of timid, collected, but open - talking about niece, coloring. relatively plain clothing, but rich, funky scarf. inoffensive overall. (no good look at face..) the man, listening in tune, a gentle demeanor, light british accent, kind, bald, chiseled face. moving into description of story. adult dating. clear opinions, personal habits shared. directed conversations, that flow. [current topic: online dating, discussing related article shared from previous conversation. growing into: relationship with technology. ebbs and flows. now: aziz ansari. invested, don’t really want to leave. how i got into meditation. how am i going to improve my mind?] </div><div><br/></div><div>oh right the whole work thing that’s a whole thing</div><div><br/></div><div>transgender prison guard transitioning to woman. interesting, cool, etc, but really seeing how i, at the moment, cannot fully imagine legitimacy of gender transition. or, maybe more accurately, do not see</div><div><br/></div><div>a sort of deeper understanding of ui starting to emerge. understanding in more concrete, critique-able way why mac is better in certain ways. not because it allows for more productivity, necessary. windows better for that possible. but partitioning tasks in a way that allows for some mental collection and calmness. i feel better. also i don’t work on this. but in visual design terms, less box-shadow. more fades, blurs. rounded edges. toolbar that shows bare minimum, and brings up relevant info when necessary. a search that isn’t cluttered, does not bring up extraneous information. and like look at this subtle box shadow it’s beautiful.</div><div><br/></div><div>every once in a while i check my steps.</div><div><br/></div><div>sometimes thinking something and then thinking about thinking it in a cool way.</div><div>i guess this is the ego.</div><div><br/></div><div>oh - major fuckup at work</div><div><br/></div><div>scrolling up and down and determining that this is maybe enough content for me to leave diesel...</div><div><br/></div><div>4/3</div><div><br/></div><div>Last night a Sunday</div><div>Morning at Forge working meticulously. On the details. Note reader / formatter page. Prob should not be working in such details but also - somewhat effective.</div><div>Heated mental debate - left hand nav delineated with right vertical border, or no border, just horizontal header lines for focus problem and goal. Settling on latter..</div><div>Thinking wavering between idea of one vs two clicks to see full note. Small preview and then full preview with metadata? Good if nesting at intervention level, bad otherwise? </div><div>And of course, revisiting the care plan structure again. Deciding to leave option open of just goal level notes.</div><div>And and also revisiting quick note workflow. In latter, how to quickly allow user to add goals? Directly from dropdown?</div><div>These thoughts, taking with me as I nap, drift to sleep <a dir="ltr"/><a dir="ltr">5pm</a>.</div><div><br/></div><div>Joining yahya, vash, andre (Romanian, arash's friend after) at ramen. </div><div>Skating to the restaurant, actually relatively smoothly. Air Force ones, good for your feet. </div><div>Siavash asking who my favorite artists are. Deliberating, telling him. Though his response not met with too much attention. And posing the question bag - shrugging, Unenthusiastically, and saying 'I asked you b/c there's a lot of music you don't share with me'. And, thinking, how representative - approaching conversation from selfish end, offering only own terms. And ramen, god damn it sick of ramen.</div><div>Over drink at saloon, evil vs good in the world, mass manipulation (Cambridge analytica, evil ad company) in the air. Difficult to transition to other topics after. Or maybe not.</div><div><br/></div><div>The bus the bus leaving the bus a</div><div><br/></div><div>4/7</div><div><br/></div><div>Lately things, things lately.</div><div>Wednesday, Nemr talk. Simplifying middle eastern politics. Bad guys in power, everyone else trying to get by. &amp; power vacuums. A message of mobilizing, productivity over political correctness. Engage w everyone, even the racists. Arabs partly to blame for our reputation. The latter not true, but I suppose a way of instilling a sense of duty. Rhetoric of America, American influence. Maybe pandering to westerners too much. Oh but amazing story about pretending to be foreign security guard for American ambassador in order to prevent muttawa from entering comedy venue.</div><div>Lingering after. Checking out girl with black Air Force one, faded jeans. Nemr's girlfriend, it turns out. Also, nagine, cute Persian girl initially joining for dinner then retracting (salad in hand). Standing not so awkwardly, awake sharp and observing. In conversation with George, purely in Arabic. MD/researcher at the Broad Institute. And god damn it's limited. How to get better? (Same thoughts echoing in cab ride back, with Moroccan driver. Sort of holding my own. Starting pack of questions - family, work and tracing relationship to home). </div><div><br/></div><div>Dinner, easy, flowing. Walking in, Reem, Nemr's gf, showing intense interest in conversation. Cut off at doorway (as I'm holding door for everyone), but remembers to continue, eagerly. Respect(s). Talking about Digital District, Beirut's Silicon Valley. Teaching coding to refugee children. Should maybe try it.</div><div>Nemr, an excellent conversationalist. Extreme confidence (speaking well of own speech, aware and secure in what he's good at). His eye contact, though brief, rotating amongst everyone at the table, meaningful, penetrating. (In contrast to Eric Benoit's intense contact from Invo - looking at eyes but not at me..like the eyes are a target or I'm transparent and there's something directly behind me). How he meet Reem, his girlfriend. Creating wall around her as fight breaks out. What stories. </div><div><br/></div><div>I don't like gifys.</div><div><br/></div><div>Deep house <a dir="ltr"/><a dir="ltr">night, thursday</a>. i’m going out tonight, going to go out tonight.</div><div>next morning, slightly groggy at work. but functional // okay // not too tired just not sharp. and hey this is kind of okay. self-destructive cycles. appreciating usual sharpness only now. </div><div><br/></div><div><a dir="ltr"/><a dir="ltr">Monday night</a>, chilling with yahya. Him and Siavash coming in a little drunk. Informed of this news after having abstract, confusing philosophical conversation w yahya about why people need to work and suffer. Drunk status undermining legitimacy of conversation. </div><div>previous night, ramen (sick, sick of ramen, god so selfish, etc etc thoughts @ siavash and how his desires prioritized though i suppose not that inconsiderate because he knows that, realistically we don’t care -  i don’t care - about where we’re going to eat, but this assumption..no this presumptuousness that he knows what i know and he can comfortably assume that others will enjoy what he enjoys .. the issue). but sitting next to andre chupon - romanian, friend of the rash’s (arash + sia - andre recalling how he thought siavash was named siarash). coolness i imagined producing a different figure, so slightly surprised when meeting mild mannered, nice, if a little nerdy dude. in phd program for econ b/c slacked and didn’t do enough math towards the end of college. how math was, for him, like a sickness. lived it, breathed it, just loved loved math. just fascinating. an interesting, unconventional thought pattern / habit brain allowed him to form. skirting through the ‘big’ broad topics, life, and job, and etc, but slowly, gradually, attentively. </div><div>oh back home and smoking a little, playing lighter game (passing mini lighter that is balanced on hand. oddly fun).</div><div><br/></div><div>two days of work, of work, it’s slower and i do the documentation package thing and other small things and think about care management a bit and it drifts, goes by quickly.</div><div> </div><div>past couple weekends this weekend not super planning the weekend but imagining configurations because because if this exercise is not done day fades?</div><div><br/></div><div>a sense of excitement. chilling opportunities in boston. can be quirky, artsy, interesting. but, per boston, requires real planning. wandering to plan dance party type thing. tickets sold out, but asking attendant at ART (american repertory theater) sup widest. talking about other shows, what she does as performance artist (once, for example, pausing fight with boyfriend, continuing on stage heated, real, fiery). did not break up, but broke up later, when asking to go to boston marathon (his reaction like gosh what a weird normal thing to do - clearly artsy n things) and, turns out to be day of (event). oh man man. walking &amp; wandering out, passing by show at <a dir="ltr"/><a dir="ltr">atomic bean cafe</a>? actually good music? &amp; then, all night performance at somerville community access television. (stereotype, judging alert) types of grimy slightly dirty mass scene hipsters jade would hang out with (but you’re so much better?). a comedy show. one dude, talking about rough neighborhoods (black guy, crowd full of white people). the next, about father’s death - this one actually funny. middle aged frumpy woman, making fun of frump. the mannerisms of comedy, comedian, performance, a visceral cringe. artificiality. is the feeling. band playing, isolated in room, but streaming on tv. out of shape shirtless dudes. okay. huh. hm. donate. community space. donate. an assumption that some of these people are privileged, deciding to frolic, do cool community art things for the community because that’s good but no it’s not good because nobody cares. (no that’s not true, take it back)</div><div><br/></div><div><a dir="ltr"/><a dir="ltr">mariposa bakery</a>. brick walls, windows, space. lacking a certain something. but the crowd varied. feeling placeless, good, placelessness is good. for me today.</div><div><br/></div><div>material design of course, ui design, should be a designer? thoughts after seeing invo put together amazing work, while me, meanwhile, coordinating, being practical. important now, but maybe maybe get creative n loose later. grad school, likely.</div><div><br/></div><div>maybe move to beirut and join this digital district, teach refugee children how to code.</div><div>oh hey ahmed coming in a couple weeks, cool.</div><div><br/></div><div>with vira yesterday talking about motivation and how she loses motivation. (vira, seriously super sad and hung up over break-up). but motivation. thinking about it in a deep way. a friend of hers, equally unmotivated, and then, branching, finding a passion a place and bam bam super successful.</div><div>&amp; other things..</div><div><br/></div><div>4/10</div><div><br/></div><div>Spring, warmth, liveliness</div><div>Mental state, mode, actions driven by outside world</div><div>Losing sense of self and thoughts and existing</div><div>Less productive but but lately</div><div>After conversation with yahya (point of life, productivity), thinking: good to chill as well</div><div>Life solution = sleep 6 hours max on weekends. Early to work, nap, then live.</div><div><br/></div><div>Productivity thoughts like</div><div>Okay bigger container of hummus next week because then less pressure to make sauce</div><div>Okay okay bake the chicken while cooking the other stuff, more streamlined multitasking</div><div>(Get this shit down, forget about it)</div><div><br/></div><div>Cliche feelings are real feelings, too.</div><div><br/></div><div>This morning, waking up to sun spilling in. Whatsapp messages, text from Nora. 10 minutes of </div><div><br/></div><div>4/10</div><div><br/></div><div>Quirky people in Boston be playing Rubik's cube, singing falsetto, rocking converse</div><div><br/></div><div>A rate of - 2 words per 10 minutes.

Siavash directing us to Render. Stopping at: a house, Christian Science church (menacing, impressive) first.</div><div><br/></div><div>On couch, hearing about: confessions of an economic hitman. How this consulting is all bullshit. Partly that they are pasted on, not approaching problem from the ground up.</div><div>Also - how world bank, IMF, etc, manipulate poor countries. Offer loan (they can never pay back) to start electricity. Leverage. Open up power plants for own countries.</div><div><br/></div><div>Coffee in the nice neighborhood, beautiful manicured park. </div><div><br/></div><div>Sugidama, two (many) meals.</div><div><br/></div><div>Zuzu, hip hop at middlesex.

Rocking the overalls.</div><div>Watermelon pickup.</div><div>Worlds longest <a dir="ltr"/><a dir="ltr">tealuxe</a> order. Nerdy glasses, rebellious blue undercut hair. Thoroughly enjoying our banter, as we cycle through confirmations of blender's death diagnosis, order switching, pulling and picking fine details, holding onto them. Blueberry white iced outside, while waiting for arash to return with bike. Pokeworks afterwards. The extra macadamia nuts. Reef's show (at house party) on Saturday. And internship, plans for summer. Going through the things. </div><div><br/></div><div>Walking back home, a light rain. Ahmed, Reef, side by side. Talking about tech, opportunities in tech, and the idea of gamifying in education. My skepticism.</div><div><br/></div><div>Home, tea, hang. Arash leaving, $120 cab to drop at location for riding 20 miles. The yuppie hobbies..</div><div><br/></div><div>Siavash's music - actually so good,  captivating, a real space. prompt sleeping at 1.</div><div><br/></div><div>Older belligerent man on the bus, muttering.</div><div><br/></div><div>Lighter spirit. Happiness. Living. Not worrying about productivity, as an alternative? Work sucks, a theme of the weekend.

Giving out a client name b/c I'm idiot. The referral network one tho, pretty cool.</div><div><br/></div><div>Too many crackers, compulsivity, and some cheese - not all cheese is good, realizing. Then home, briefly, rolling dro in boxer, and off to central. Meeting Ahmed. This past week, a little surreal. To little donkey. Ditching to smoke and walk. Talking about Arabic, Ahmed's improving with gf. </div><div><br/></div><div>Cuchi. The workdays. What I do. Value based Care and alll. Sour drinks. A little this, a little that.

no. that sounded insightful for a second, like i was getting somewhere.</div><div><br/></div><div>a to-do item, just now, emerging: talk to nick about cm registry. today at work, incredibly scattered. probably an hour spent just on google keep. re-arranging the ‘small’ to-do list. separating headers with ‘——‘. no that’s not nice, so instead ‘- - - -‘ above and below header. multiple iterations to get there.</div><div>okay i guess i like the new calendar design. my design approach is: concise, minimal.</div><div>would like to start a style guide for the web app/company.</div><div>lately at work feeling like a worker and not all-encompassing knowledge hungry, reputation-wary like i should be. just doing my thing. leaving when i wanna leave. just what i’m doing.</div><div>these people love their jobs. on the daily. on the yearly.</div><div>how much money are curved scrollbars worth?</div><div>calculating full dev effort, and cost.

imagine how others feel? repeat.</div><div>that’s all.</div><div><br/></div><div>thinking about categorizing thinking</div><div>like this is what makes you smart, productive, powerful. </div><div><br/></div><div>signing up for hacking arts. this panel on music. this other digital art thing. idk these buzzwords are perfect for me.</div><div>linkedin searching and re-structuring. okay i sound kind of good on paper now. but like design-wise:  how do i prove that am i good designer? can’t share my work. or maybe i can? can i ask arcadia permission to do this? prob not?</div><div>but then - say i leave arcadia. would need to so with: solid solid front-end interactive prototyping, xd experience. maybe some indesign?

<en-note><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">feelings about work</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">People not talking about ideas. Just tasks. Innovation, brainstorming?</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">Results of personality test. Sort of depressed and like maybe I chose wrong career? </span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">work getting progressively better.</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">but still, in head, forming exit strategy.</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">thinking, how can i extract skills that i want from this company, make myself appealing to creative places</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">classifying the types of thinking this job may demand.</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">visualizing how i can move within this company to accentuate creative side. like maybe do data analysis and visualization on the side.</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">but, why push push for creativity, squeezing it out this rigid structure, when i can start in an altogether different place,</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">that is from the ground-up, creative, innovative. even traditional consulting sounds far more dynamic.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">*not enough talk about ideas here. meetings, immediate issues are discussed. problems, tickets, troubleshooting.</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">even if logical problem-solving is challenging..does not seem to have aspect of innovation, pushing boundaries.</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">am i in a job that is not at all conducive to personality?</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">at best, getting paid to problem-solve/code. cs-applicable skills, and maybe data science/data design skills.</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">keep feeling pulled to draw career/personality path map. </span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">what can i do with this?</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">but, what next? feeling like i'm starting too too ground-up. sort of discrediting thought that starting in backend</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">will inform future work. because so deeply entrenched</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">observations: not interacting with people much. presentation, personal skills, not practice. just logical problem-solving. attention span.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">9/15 - day 5</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">mindset:</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">overall. mind, racing, running. sharp but scattered. relatively focused at work - that is, on task, work in general, but tangential thoughts, questions popping in. writing them down, but not sure it prevents vanishing.</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">attention not really wavering much throughout day.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">today feeling like - yes, this place is not innovative by structure or culture. but if i truly truly keep a will, push to be creative (though some of it may be sucked out of this place) I can find avenues.</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">**glimmer of hope: product team member who found my portfolio, commented that I deftly combine design, analysis, and hard science. looking for this skill set, and may have projects for me in the future (when ramped up).</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">more in control, less depressed.</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">this is temporary. </span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">visualizing path of taking cs courses, doing creative cs career.</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">or hopping to innovative start-up or healthcare company.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">events:</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">tutorials finished. sql review with wendong (many errors, it turns out) but he seemed decently happy with my progress? assigned to receive build request, and deploy. start and end of cycle, essentially. </span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">meeting with oren, walkthrough (simple, mundane, should be more automated, i.e. problematic fields automatically highlighted to compare). check-in with josh. confirming workflow, again, reviewing connector studio. fiddling with connector studio. workflow + informatics.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">ambitions:</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">within assembly line, see myself creating architecture, or writing queries (ideally both). even more ideally, none + different time</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">data visualization projects</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">work with product team</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">longer-term:</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">use courses to take cs pre-reqs, then potentially get 1 year master’s? looking up creative cs fields</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">creativity within data? data visualization</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">general consulting?</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">what about bme? eliminating?</span></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">problem-solving mindset:</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">stretching brain, synthesizing different workers’ process and cohesive flow.</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">memory. sql, memory and logic.</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">some socializing.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri;">other jobs (athenahealth pi?)</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri; font-kerning: none; color: #232323;">9/16</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri; font-kerning: none; color: #232323;">Events</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri; font-kerning: none; color: #232323;">Deployments. Silly (b/c should be automated), mechanical tedious. Running through with wendong.</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri; font-kerning: none; color: #232323;">Glimpsing at build requests. Form filling. Intellectually degrading.</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri; font-kerning: none; color: #232323;">Meeting w Kelsey. Architecture explained unintuitively. Waste of time.</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri; font-kerning: none; color: #232323;">Qdw server walk through, sql fiddling</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri; font-kerning: none; color: #232323;">Two stand up meetings </span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri; font-kerning: none; color: #232323;">Where did the day go?</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri; font-kerning: none; color: #232323;">**meeting product team. Exactly type of people I want to work with. Creative, spunky (mannerisms, suspenders), chill (whisky in office). Nick stepro, admiring data visualization website. Product team - support, adhoc issues, custom investigative medical reports, and data visualization, and feature determination. The dream. (At least within Arcadia)</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri; font-kerning: none; color: #232323;">Creative paths exists within company after all..</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri; font-kerning: none; color: #232323;">Observations </span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri; font-kerning: none; color: #232323;">Me. Not good at following procedures. Deployments as testimony. Also hate it. Not ashamed of this, somewhat happy?</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri; font-kerning: none; color: #232323;">Fiddling with arcadia analytics. Pretty cool..</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri; font-kerning: none; color: #232323;">Me. A bit awkward. Having to mentally prep/socially pump up for what turned out to be casual chill sesh in product office.</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri; font-kerning: none; color: #232323;">Them. Fixed, glued. Spitting jargon, cynical woos and yays at technical issues.</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri; font-kerning: none; color: #232323;">Future </span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri; font-kerning: none; color: #232323;">How quickly can I learn necessary back end skills and leave connector team?</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri; font-kerning: none; color: #232323;">Because need to leave connector team.</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri; font-kerning: none; color: #232323;">Seems like - learn to write query, task flows &amp; architecture</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri; font-kerning: none; color: #232323;">Brain state-</span></div><div><span style="font: 12.0px Calibri; font-kerning: none; color: #232323;">Now a bit upset that I'm not so upset?

Maybe learning by thrown into task is good, but lack of real training and mentorship creates inefficient environment.

Frustration hindering me from managing many many tasks I have to fill at once. And also from being creative, playing with procedure and improving. Partly because procedure is source of frustration </span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font: 11.0px 'Helvetica Neue'; font-kerning: none;">Structure not conducive to innovation. Connector is not, and will not be innovative. Scoffing at innovation day. </span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font: 11.0px 'Helvetica Neue'; font-kerning: none;">What it means to be part of something large. </span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font: 11.0px 'Helvetica Neue'; font-kerning: none;">Division of labor.

hey, okay - maybe i can write better). &amp;&amp; post ny sleep catch up. 5 hours gone?</div><div><br/></div><div>spending sunday with alisse very completely lazing around. waking up early - 8:30. cuddling. sex. eating babka (choco bread) near bed. wrestling. cuddling. pb sandwiches. then: beatles albums, on the floor. liking the atmospheric stuff and panning.</div><div><br/></div><div>stupid thoughts of: why isn’t she holding my hand right now. already getting so much attention and physical affection and still questioning.</div><div><br/></div><div>okay not writing about this jealousy and insecurity stuff meaningfully. need to 1) feel good about myself. genuinely. like i am good-looking and interesting. 2) feel confident in alisse’ relationship to me.</div><div><br/></div><div>looking at my naked body, over and over, expecting a spark - of satisfaction, pride - to spark.</div><div><br/></div><div>alisse taking up so much of my mental space. thinking: what would i be thinking without her. so much room and space.</div><div><br/></div><div>work things: referral app project going well. staying on top, doing in right. but still pending: interactive mockups for entry for page. yesterday, no coffee, little focus. sprint planning and some small UI mockups.</div><div><br/></div><div>hey you wanted the crazy back and it came back and you wrote a lot. cool?</div><div><br/></div><div>how alisse realized why i was reluctant / slightly nervous maybe, to text her.</div><div><br/></div><div>on the train with may. me, staring, her flashcards. a picture of a liver.</div><div><br/></div><div>a complete asshole to alisse on saturday. short and grumpy. a little aggressive. she handles this calmly. a little short with me, in return, sometimes. but not before trying to attempt some nice conversation. meeting up w me. kissing me. telling me about her dinner: i know you’re not crazy about pasta but this was really good. and i am half listening. and i talk much more in-depth about myself. questioning, also, whether alisse really had plans for saturday night, and why we had to leave. like oh ‘what would you have done’. negative energy. stopping later, for gas, and her commenting on my awful breath. realizing she asked what i had for dinner purely for this reason. and like damn i’ve been driving and cuddling and this is what you are saying. but: hey, she held back for a while.</div><div>getting home. showering. having sex. things are better.</div><div>this whole time: overplaying the fragility. so worried about how i was asshole. alisse seeing as ‘you were in a mood’. </div><div><br/></div><div>11/9</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>--</div><div><br/></div><div>now </div><div><br/></div><div>okay more me more self expression</div><div>post stranger things (an endearing episode)</div><div>post poop</div><div>post: look at dishes, weigh the cost benefit of cleaning. decide: not to clean</div><div>post: look at new (from amazon) contigo water bottle, clean, wash, test sip. not even thirsty</div><div>post: thinking -

<div>12/25 (DALLAS)</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>bits of conversation:</div>
<div>
<div>Smelly Americans getting smelling dogs</div>
<div>Caving birds fucked up</div>
<div>Words exchanged, between nihaya, Asma, Mama. Meanwhile, raeda watching vine length videos </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>All these samples make you fat</div>
<div>Husbands poorly dressed - except for nihaya's</div>
<div>Repeat joke, broadcast </div>
<div>Me style and Obaydeh's</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Why is your hair like that</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The fake people say I love you and compliment</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Every daycare needs camera</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div>Mama funny on the first joke, then it comes 20 more times</div>
<div>(the ladies all laughing at this)</div>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/26</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>up today, 8:30. mama, nihaya in the kitchen. eggs and potatoes a background theme, coming gradually into the forefront. difficult to pull topic of conversation. because - nonstop chatter, with few focused topics. something about: asma probably.  imitations of her. the sighs, helplessness over small matters.</div>
<div>in head: echoing yesterday / baba's family story: seto being 13 when tayseer is 4 (mother dying from chicken pox, father finding new wife). does not consider his mother, hardly visits. apparently somewhat cruel to her. (but also: incredibly impressive that he got to his current position and stature. parkinson's now though, setting in). seto: 7 miscarriages, then 5 daughters (2 sons after). seto, probably around 85. healthy. </div>
<div>eggs and potatoes. delicious, frittata-like texture. eating eating but this time mindful, stopping at right time.</div>
<div>topics of studying and AP and SAT and mama sort of showing off my SAT scores. confusion in understanding her pride towards me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>raeda, living in baton rouge, and yet, expressing real surprise at the fact that there a lot of poor people in america. really? and comment that you need doctor-ish salary to live a good life.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>nihaya calling me her cutie, cute, my cute many many times throughout day.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on a walk with shayma. passing rundown mexican shops, nightclubs. witnessing what might be a drug deal. and talking about gender norms in islam, the pressure to get married and enter unfulfilling relationship for no reason. thread connecting to yahya after break-up - and siavash's reality of miserable marriages.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>an example of ~ frustrating conversations ~. articulating desire to go to nice coffee shop. mama: why not starbucks? why not work here? noor has a nice lounge did you see that? these suggestions thrown out merely to stir arguments. a first layer of frustration. second, not trying hard to actually understand what it is i want. instead imposing what i might want. this second bit perhaps a bit more understandable, as parent difficult to accept child's autonomy? this method of conversation though, too common (same with jobs, throwing out suggestions).  suggesting i become a fancy nurse. what the fuck? do you know what i do? </div>
</div>
<div>also - comment that i wasted my biomedical engineering degree.</div>
<div style="font-size: 14px;">empty, sometimes provocative suggestions and comments as conversation starters. </div>
<div style="font-size: 14px;">and then - inability to carry out conversation after initial provocation. hopeless. surrender.</div>
<div>sometimes abusing my attempts to be a good listening. because comment often repeat, or shallow, and sort of unfairly grasping a large portion of my brain. harsh?</div>
<div>
<div style="font-size: 14px;"><br/></div>
<div style="font-size: 14px;">snippets:</div>
<div style="font-size: 14px;">taking voice recording, random voice recording during conversation. and multiple voices talking over each other.</div>
<div style="font-size: 14px;">asma, orchestrating a lion king holding of her baby, after mama's misguided lion king joke (isn't this like what they did to jesus? no.)</div>
<div style="font-size: 14px;">burberry baby clothing.</div>
<div style="font-size: 14px;">raeda taking care of asma's child.</div>
</div>
<div style="font-size: 14px;">she's pretty, she's fat, she's this, she's that</div>
<div style="font-size: 14px;">preventing conversational loop by telling mama to stop trying to incite me with stupid suggestions. nihaya, mama, sitting back like: wow look how he talks so clear and smart. not. my point. where did you get your vocabulary, asks mama?</div>
<div>
<div style="font-size: 14px;">suggesting to get patches for siblings. seeing my shirt and bursting out into laughter. asma, trying immediately to take a snap video.</div>
<div style="font-size: 14px;">munching steadily throughout the day. can you get the chips from the car?</div>
<div style="font-size: 14px;">do you want a wife like ? from?</div>
<div style="font-size: 14px;">costco, sam's club plans.</div>
</div>
<div style="font-size: 14px;">the word 'high class'. hatha high class.</div>
<div style="font-size: 14px;">a genuine feeling for poor people. giving homeless people money, meals. we’re materialistic consumers but somewhat in touch with commonplace difficulties that exist outside our sphere.</div>
<div>
<div style="font-size: 14px;"><br/></div>
<div style="font-size: 14px;">noor's attractive, intelligent hijabi friend marwa. an affinity for broad, systems-level thinking driving her to do global health fellowship. understanding that my job is 'future of healthcare'. 3rd year resident. oo. rania, a little spacey, nearby, relaying story of ordering orange juice at coffee shop, receiving hipster outrage.</div>
</div>
<div style="font-size: 14px;">work on my job pitch. work on it. for ego, yes. </div>
<div style="font-size: 14px;"><br/></div>
<div>allowing myself to deduce patterns of interaction here, delve deep into categorizing people. no need to give benefit of the doubt here - move directly into assumptions. because need to develop toolkit, mobilize, and find best ways of acting to family in thoughtful, considerate way.</div>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>gender norms within a relationship discussed. saying that i will share responsibility for raising kid. do not want 'family-oriented' woman. in parallel, and actually related: baba telling ahmad that noor's money is hers, and that he pays the bills. the concern of needing to withdraw</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<div>baba as very rational, though using religion as means of negotiating logic. mama, emotional. completely. no clear value basis.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>driving noor's car, imagining life here. feeling ever more thankful for pace, enrichment, and intellectual vitality in my life.</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>mindlessly shopping online yesterday. because realizing that being fully present is not really necessary. family appreciates just being there. just being me and existing. a neutral, though somewhat positive force.</div>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on the mind lately - health. healthcare.</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<div>at oak lawn coffee in dallas. a nice, sunny, hipstery spot. in domain of pet stores. a nice place to walk? asking barista. clyde warren park. like, been there. (park suspended in highway-ville).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>incredibly jittery horny leaving coffee shop. this same feeling, perhaps, driving unproductivity when working from home. less strong coffee, more slowly.</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>noor's apartment, medical district drive. sterile, minimal. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>12/30</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the day like</div>
<div>wake up</div>
<div>stiff on the furry carpet, not enough padding</div>
<div>obaydah having left earlier to transfer to new sleeping earlier</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>mama, raeda, nihaya chilling in the lofted living room</div>
<div>talk talking</div>
<div>asma's house</div>
<div>extravagant, large, a bit tacky. so many objects and items. in the living room: glittery painting, enormous clock. tree holding baby shoes. stock photography everywhere.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>texas / southern / american life. driving everywhere.</div>
<div>most of way from dallas, then to houston, blasting kendrick. en route to houston, leaving at 11. constant conversation. not liking 'boom boom' from my blasting music. playing quran at some point, from phone. really? usual gossip &amp; things. stopping by at buccee's, enormous texan spectacle / gas station. everything served. names &amp; numbers constantly called over loudspeaker. texas texas texas. continuing route as noor makes calls to find unicorn onesie. stop at target. reversing poorly and almost hitting car. mama's 'yee omar’, for once, a valid and useful warning. going to raeda's and underestimating time it takes to get there. raeda asking how far we are, in minutes. then, in miles. other units?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in asma's house. oogling eying furniture / set-up. beautiful home, questionable objects. woman woman everywhere. talking to summer doof on the phone for a bit about umrah prep. (so - decided to do umrah with seto after all, despite me warnings)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>meeting with kareem at like 4:30. at alexis's. a little pre-dinner smoke, each of us talking about work. me, how job is much better. alexis and perils of last project. extension / patches on a continued failed project. implementing some software. people joking about suicide / dying instead. oh my. sharing my job and excitement now. glad to not be conveying again how my job is miserable. not asking kareem enough about himself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>indian restaurant after. kimji joining. talkative, loud engaging. having many people over to visit. getting into people they know. and me, feeling bad, because i killed the conversation by looking over to kareem and asked 'do you know these people?'. jobs that are most useful during the apocalypse. things &amp; other things. a nice moment: looking at kareem, smiling. tell us what kareem was like in high school? he says, more temperamental. i don't know. pretty chill.</div>
<div>(eating too much. ice cream after. then cake at the house. and little bit more at restaurant).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>andi &amp; brahm joining. tall fairly attractive white girl, super tall handsome persian dude. in med school. talking about ob gyn / vaginas / delivering babies.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back home. slow but not uncomfortable conversation with obaydah. walking in, yeezy's, joggers, and baby in hand. small what's ups. then leaving, shortly after for a true arab scene at shisha cafe. guys introducing with salams. obaydah's friend mohammed, tall, bearded, friendly looking. peppering sentences with bro. all of them describing recent trip to california. mohammed a bit less pleased, others sleeping in &amp; fucking around. but them: enjoying, loving it. asking me what i do, what they do. mohammed in suppy chain management. SCM - how he introduced his position to me. okay cool cool. just hanging chilling listening to misc stories. someone's family member getting married. table full of assorted associated family members. leaving, maybe around 1. me, obaydah (in jaguar), and mohammed going to new shisha cafe, with amazing food. food as amazing, vibe as arab as advertised. old big screens, bright lights, men playing cards, cigs in hand (likely muttering kus immak) to each other. talking about mohammed's lebanese girlfriend. muslim, parents know about her now. has fooled around, but now, 25, mature, ready to get married.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my vernacular here. looser, less precise. even includes 'and shit' sometimes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>coming home, smoking. behind the pool. rawan smokes too? thinking like - all of the men in hamdanfamily are somewhat rebellious // smoke drink etc.</div>
<div>and chatting about our arabic level, trips to jordan. potential of moving back at some point. laughing chilling. </div>
<div>walking back into the house, after smoking. seeing huge pile of dishes, obaydah commenting that they’re gonna have a blast cleaning all of this. sort of like getting drunk and forgetting. hosting azuma, cleaning. but commenting that it’s cute.</div>
<div>obaydah’s overall perspective on seeing sisters / aunts socialize, more forgiving, less privy to criticizing copious amounts of gossip and shit talk.</div>
<div>4am, coming back in to sleep on hard hard floor.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>be here be present be appreciative. this is rare.</div>

<div>1/1/2017</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>up late - 11:15, and rushing to get ready for breakfast at suhaib's. getting there (slightly frustratingly) late. me in back of jaguar coupe, raeda in front. full spread of 3araby breakfast cuisine awaiting, along with conversation of unsolicited advice. raeda waking up baby in the middle of night = child abuse? jokes. overeating, as usual, and moving over to living room. poking yahya’s belly for instant laughter. little bit of header ball in living room. outside, as obaydah smokes, talking about (not very seriously) quick paths to get rich. idea from shayma: rate my substitute. pretty great. could be a cool thing to work on. sahib talking about easy things like mowing stores lawns. oh. resourcefulness in lame way. mama, nihaya, shayma’s cousin flipping through photos of sahib’s wedding. (a glimpse of me, in dorky glasses and mediocre suit)</div>
<div>a fight with sara and ibrahim. sara resisting last minute travel plans to dallas. three ba</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>2ck and forth before agreeing to leave.</div>
<div>imagining dynamic of always doing business with father. asking obaydah about this, and talking about how they always interact/discuss things. mostly works, but obaydah disagrees a lot lot.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back from brunch maybe around 3. women packing. doddling, sipping 3araby coffee, chatting.</div>
<div>to mama - are you dreading going back home? not really. need to sleep. a surprising comment.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>en route back to boston. hobby airport, 'the newest 4 star airport'.</div>
<div>overhearing a rice connection. a woman, going back and forth asking questions, stimulating a conversation. sort of like a mediator. turns out, man on right, women to left, rice grads. wait no, maybe dad only went to rice? i think UT. accounting. 'well this is fun, our little delay'.</div>
<div>me, making most of day. hitting yasser (ob cousin) mansion. and ballin. 10 points to close hey, that's not bad.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>airport.</div>
<div>trying to understand if dude is super conservative or lib. okay no wait liberal. remove financial benefits of marriage. semantic discussion of using word civil union instead of marriage. this guy, willing to give civil union with no financial benefits. but no marriage. libertarian.</div>
<div>considering music but would love to just overhear.</div>
<div>the south. houston. makes me feel alive in some ways.</div>
<div>the ride back from yasser's to airport. endorphins floating, a clear and earnest tit for tat about career ambitions. obaydeh's next 10 years planned. after cars, hands in multiple businesses. eventually, expansion to houston.</div>
<div>intent eavesdropping leading to a real conversation. with gloria, besides me, molly, middle-aged woman in the middle, and the dude. first, polite exchange of opinions regarding the same topic. a couple circular exchanges. then a more focused side conversation with glorida. rice architecture grad with family in houston. 2 years abroad in rwanda. smiley. telling me about relationship with her new boyfriend. asking how they met (online - specific app not disclosed because well i'm a stranger - fair enough  i suppose). about rwanda, program relatively effective when attendees were actually interested in helpoing - though apparently like half people from program actually just really seeking to explore and have fun? not what i expected. and and. also: healthy, unfriendly life in north vs opposite in south.</div>
<div>i really hope i run into you! that would be super fun. thinking maybe to take her number and like hey maybe let's have coffee. but - actually running into each other instead would maybe just be more fun. (that and, both of us mature to know that most likely we won't meet up, and don't need to validate each other).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>airplane.</div>
<div>continuing bon iver re-listens. a little bit more brilliant, cohesive, environment-like. still far from grasping idea behind album, and developing deep connection. but beauty apparent. listening while mind also drifts. to usual fucked up fantasies of family member disaster that's being conveyed while on date. or with girl or something like that. because i want people to show me pity? what the fuck. need to get rid of these fantasies. also: potential of opening of business in the future with OB. picturing ourselves in many years from now. and: breakding down the general acknowledgement of blessing into concrete categories. why my family is great. why i'm so grateful to have my family. to have this strange but beautiful dynamic.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sufficiently left and exited my state of mind. this break.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hamdan family socialization- strange but beautiful but toxic environment .</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>branching off silly marriage proposals, seeing young fams (ibrahim, suhaib), and talking, more in depth about careers, with ability to compare to my experience. thinking realy really about what it means to start a family, start a life, settle down. and also: the sisters</div>
<div>aging aging</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thought lately: focus on natural decay of our bodies .</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>late night episode of animals</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at frat party. described only with word spectacle.</div>
<div>kareem sticking around because true friend but clearly not feeling after a while</div>
<div>before, at cafe with aramcon friend</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sort of beautiful seeing a large family grow and change. this thought sprouting mainly from thoughts of shayma &amp; her work as a teacher. but now, picturing the family. all of us. our mistakes, personalities, disputes. binding love.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>1/2</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>2017. okay.</div>
<div>window insulation sort of working, back feels cold still though while writing. </div>
<div>today insular calming therapeutic. evidence for introvert tendencies type of day. happy no one has come into house. waking at 9, super tired. doing groceries. slowly, super tired. cooking brunch &amp;&amp; meals. revitalizing with coffee, unpacking.</div>
<div>a call from tanya, around 1. slump break. felt useless, unproductive, trapped by environment of jersey suburb. and disenchanted with society. sad to see the suburbs and people settling. sharing similar sentiment.</div>
<div>book about elderly, how we decay and die. getting a bit into policy perspective. but also the thought of us decaying and dying. inevitable and important.</div>
<div>(avoided topic of death when siavash first brought up. policy/medicine more palatable avenue for me to approach this. honestly skeptical of siavash’s initial engrossment in topic. now, maybe still skeptical? not trying to prepare for death. or maybe i am. but trying to prepare for others’ aging and death. so i can act appropriately, help. either way - shouldn’t claim superiority. siavash has foresight and wisdom to look into important topic like this)</div>
<div>being a doctor or like creating some community thing i don’t know to help people feeling very important today.</div>
<div>explaining job to people - who don’t get it - making me less enthusiastic about work. can’t just say ‘i’m doctor’ or consultant or manager. partly an ego thing, but partly - a feeling that what i do is hidden and insignificant. want others to validate my career and interest. (conversation with mama where i set out to exclusively do this. unsuccessful.).</div>
<div>work out in room, refreshed and alive. </div>
<div>cooking quietly, eating slowly, while reading.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>organist podcast earlier today - an interview with architect talking about sound in architecture. how frequencies can shape behavior - bass slows people down, treble speeds up. balance of absorbent and reflective materials create this. example of throwing absorbing material into a modern home to create better sound.</div>
<div>example of library in alexandria, creating a series of pathways to quiet room, that transition person from noisy streets / life to slower pace. cannot simply create a perfectly quiet zone.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>another: philosopher talking about memory and sound. loves pop music because it readily evokes memories? though not clear why it does so more than other music. predictability perhaps? how our narrative construction of self is bullshit..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>being mortal, atul gawande. the current read. fascinating so far. structure of elderly care. assisted living, a radical idea of offering freedom to elderly, even when sick. how young director of elderly care clinic, against all odds and standards, brought 100 birds, dogs, cats in. saving people’s lives by giving them a purpose. something to care for.</div>
<div>a clear conclusion: people need independence to be happy.</div>
<div>book now delving into the question of - what gives life meaning?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this book + healthy, independent intellectual life that contrasts with ~life in the south~ pushing me to be **actively happy**. i’m. fucking. blessed. in older age. having a few simple pleasures, and some independence is all you can ask for. what i have now, unbelievable, amazing.</div>

<en-note><div>12/30</div><div><br/></div><div>bad things, patterns lately. organized okay let's go.</div><div>like. eating nuts as breakfast replacement. check the calories? should i have eaten this. (unnecessary diet monitoring)</div><div>another. full. pie in front of me. that i did not order. that was given as extra. finishing half. wrapping. and then: combatting idleness by unwrapping, finishing rest. stomach. ugh. why i do that. (self control)</div><div>watching kid on plane. take a snap quickly, thoughtlessly. do not send. and then look at sent section. and toggle back and forth, not actually reading or accomplishing thing.</div><div>today, yesterday, every thought gap filled with: face analysis. prompted by mama's commets: why is your face so long. and then, looking at my face differently. branching expanding. into:</div><div>face shape: can one be handsome with / in spite of oblong face. asos model, ben affleck, others, evidence as yes, you can. so my face shape is okay.</div><div>face shape - finer, personal analysis: two problems with face: asymmetry (right side lower, longer), and narrowness. i think first maybe natural. looking at older photos. but i guess more stretched given that face is longer.</div><div>verifying looks: staring at every mirror. why do i look good sometimes, bad others. </div><div>looks as environmental: noor, mama, summer's faces, actually quite nice. and mine as child maybe okay kind of proportional? i don't know. i have nice features / could have been handsome maybe?</div><div>orthodontic reflection: get jaw expander</div><div>hours googling my orthodontic procedure - should i have teeth removed? should my a</div><div>aging: will my face somehow i don't get weirder weirder. well i collect fat in cheeks i think so that's good.</div><div>countering: no my face is just long and proportional. like my eyes are close together right. not affected by jaw. jaw expander couldn't have done that much. mostly the bite fixing that makes difference in before/after photos i see. i mean actually - just defer to ortho appointment jan 25 for this. and there's dimension. jawline looks nice.</div><div>and: i have cute girlfriend so guess people like it? ask alisse - do you like my face even when my hair is short and clean shaven?</div><div>actually: i think lots of people like it / see it as okay moderately attractive. but are fooled by style and hair. like i know how to work the face. i look at the colors and see what works.</div><div>accept regardless?</div><div>like. what does my face look like. what do me eyes see. is this what others see.</div><div>aesthetics. what are aesthetics.</div><div>so not super present.</div><div>cannot let go of music glued to headphones because cannot delve into me / self</div><div>----</div><div>videos of baby summer / yousuf. summer shaking booty. posing. so cute. doof a chubby cheek dweller.</div><div>the earrings. </div><div>devil in a dress god damn this is good.</div><div>-----</div><div>things i want to do:</div><div>- order gifts</div><div>- look up spain stuff</div><div><br/></div><div>1/6 morning</div><div><br/></div><div>shuffling with things. tool/utility draw in kitchen &gt; tea, coffee, chocolated drawer. a neuroticism flourishes, taming and quelling because organization is not efficiency.</div><div>then figuring out day (= target errands, work work, stretch, work out, hang w eric)</div><div><br/></div><div>assessing: how good, social, confident, do i feel around different groups of people? why? alisses’ friend’s, quite. noticing with brown friends, pretty confident, but less talkative.</div><div><br/></div><div>oral posture, dominating thoughts for a few days (today/yesterday, only intermittent). leading to: sore jaw, lisp, drool. but how i bite normally? i forget. just need to figure that out and i’ll be all set.</div><div><br/></div><div>fixing posture one of the few things that is easier to learn/habitualize when you are an over thinker. because soon: you forget what your original posture was like. and you disrupt habit/consciousness/intuition because obsessive thoughts are invading brain. interesting. other things like this? i suppose any habit change?</div><div><br/></div><div>last night dinner with alisse, savannah, laura, hannah, tai. mediocre pizza. then: shoveling snow. my car, her car, driveway, katie’s car. workout. hunger. alisse tired, kind of feeling staying at her house (though discussed coming back to mine, bubble bathing, etc). brain going down path of: she only wants to hang out when it’s convenient for her, she doesn’t like me. not in bad mood bad mood just sort of subtly exploring this thought pattern. alisse, detecting this. asking me what’s up, gently. i explain, some. then again, gently prodding for more. amazing. and i tell her, realize that thoughts are irrational. </div><div><br/></div><div>i am so interesting to me (reading texts, look at photos, etc), and therefore: i am an narcissist.</div><div><br/></div><div>face status: face is definitely long, but gets wider when gaining weight. also asymmetrical. but eyes and demeanor are attractive maybe. and that’s kind of enough to get the cuties. also: i do see the negativity in my face. staring at others and kind of morphing their face as i focus on just length. but still - it’s long, and maybe i have to accept that. seeking: understanding of attractivity, how i fit in scale of cuties hotties. because that’s helpful?</div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday today days before cold cold cold. snow mounts &amp; trenches on the floor. ‘why do i live here’, so salient.</div><div><br/></div><div>work on my arabic- when?</div><div><br/></div><div>coco may visiting over weekend.</div><div>unfortunately occupied with thoughts of face, oral posture. for real. these thoughts dissolving when alisse comes back - maybe because time? or maybe vibe. </div><div>a day with coco (jan 1). breakfast, drop off may to coffee shop. then: home depot. shelving and projector set-up. we productive. dave chapelle special (problematic, interesting, sometimes resonant).</div><div>though i love doing nothing</div><div>jan 2 - work / may’s exam. coming back to may + ashleigh at the crib. smoke &gt; tasty momo &gt; boba. kind of like - why did i smoke? home and - black mirror i think? episodes in which: creepy software developer makes game with real humans and they try to escape, in which: mom monitors daughter (horrifying consequences).</div><div><br/></div><div>a feeling of: giving up the self a bit to alisse. priorities become trivial when compared to hanging w her. setting up for devastation. but something beautiful about trivializing things that are important to me.</div><div>i think i can learn and grow with alisse. she gets me. more important than: her habits and things.</div><div>check yourself tho. work work, set yourself up for success.</div><div>not writing much lately, like i am dissolving. check yourself, check yourself.</div><div><br/></div><div>looking up how to keep / maintain stubble and then - getting research articles about how stubble, as opposed to full beard or clean shaven, is more attractive for love marriage sex. shows some maturity, but not too much sort of. like masculine but still young. who is funding this study? why?</div><div><br/></div><div>okay i’m done</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></en-note>
