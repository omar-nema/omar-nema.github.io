From the ground-up, we *designed* our system to be flexible. 

We provided our users (managers of the Brown Design Workshop) with a booklet for assembling our STROL-120 units (no power tools required, just some elbow grease and a wrench).   All tool-holders, and structural support pieces (apart from prefabricated 80/20) were laser cut. Missing pieces, or small adjustments to pre-existing components can simply be remedied using our pre-made files.
