          Medical referral networks - like the one I visualized below - are complex, and ripe for optimization. Similar to social communities, referral networks tend to cluster in groups. Referral circles build around social relationships between providers.
          <span class="info-tooltip">
          These known specialists may not be the best option for the patient. Provider ratings, availability, and patient preferences are not always weighed in the process of choosing a specialist. Less costly, or more effective providers are often underlooked. To add to this, the process of referral submission and approval is convoluted - resulting in a high processing time.

          I collaborated with a development team at Arcadia.io to build <strong>a web application that empowers physicians to find high-quality, in-network providers for patients</strong>. My role in this project spanned research, product design (UX/UI/user research), internal product management, and external product implementation.

               In redesigning the referral process and building a new platform, my goal was to both reduce patient wait time for referrals, and improve the quality of provider selection on referrals.

                In the case of a behavioral health referral, the provider submits a referral request. The referral manager then contacts the patient, and works to understand their needs and preferences. The process ends when the patient is matched with a provider who they feel comfortable engaging with.

                Finding a provider typically involves a few exchanges with the patient and provider. Referral managers will typically opt to bookmark a few providers, and gradually narrow down to a single provider based on  availability and fit.

          <div class="subheader">Rules Engine</div>
          <p>
          In additional to Behavioral Health referrals, providers can submit requests for procedural medical referrals. Medical referrals requests are automatically processed (as in-network, out-of-network, or exception) using a rules engine that is configured by the client.
          </p>
          <p>
          The 'referral network' is a surprisingly fluid concept, as health systems frequently adjust the specialties that they are looking to retain in-network, or direct externally. I designed the rules engine to accommodate this flexibility. Users can group patient insurance, specialties, patient age, and region into individual rules.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block-text">
        <div class="subheader">Referral Submission</div>
        <p>
        Given the complexity of referral networks - providers are not always aware of whether a given referral is in or out of network. To address this, our referral management system displays the applied rule prior to referral submission (see bottom right image).
        </p>
        <p>
          After a medical referral is submitted, it is routed to referral manager with a suggested action for moving the case forward. This action is dynamic, and dependent on the applied rule. For example, an out of network referral will show a suggested action to escalate to a medical director for approval.
        </p>

      <div class="block-text">
          <p>
          Actions from the referral management system feed into reporting tables (used by analysts and clinical leadership). I developed a reporting schema (in SQL), and set of visualized reports on Tableau to track referral outcomes. These reporting tables offer insight into network performance, and productivity by referral manager, and medical director.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below, a visual I built using the reporting model, and d3.js. This visual focuses on x-ray referrals and MRI referrals in a large medical network. In both procedure categories, we see clustering around high-cost, or out-of-network providers -- and thus an opportunity to improve referral patterns.
