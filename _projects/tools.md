title: tool<br>storage
time: fall 2014
heading: STROL-120 is an integrated tool and hardware storage system that I  designed, prototyped and constructed over the course of a semester with Danica Mitchell, Patricia Dranoff, and Connor Lynch. The system was designed to accommodate a new makerspace at Brown University. Though my (making) focus has shifted to digital design, this project provided me a valuable foundation in design research.

        Goals.
        <ul>
        <li>Maximize space - in the crowded workshop</li>
        <li>Accommodate - the changing needs and resources of the workshop</li>
        <li>Be invisible - a facilitator, and not a barrier - of the fabrication process</li>
        </ul>

        Space distribution  - rather than working near one tool wall in the crammed workshop, our Y-shape allows students to spread out, and distribute space more efficiently. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Flexibility  - We used a combination of fixed and movable tool tool racks. High-demand (low-supply) tools are fixed to the wall, but common tools can be pulled used the cart.

        Modularity/long-term- we provided our users (managers of the Brown Design Workshop) with a booklet for assembling our STROL-120 units (no power tools required!).

        Modularity / short-term - all tool-holders, and structural support pieces (apart from prefabricated 80/20) were laser cut. Missing pieces, or small adjustments to pre-existing components can simply be remedied using our pre-made files.

        Tech details- Y-shaped laser cut (right) aluminum centerpieces attach to the 80/20 ribs, binding the three walls of the cart together. Tool holders, were designed in SolidWorks, laser cut from sheet aluminum, and attached with (hand-tightened) thumb screws through slots in each panel that align with the 80/20 skeleton inside.

        <p>Field research - observed students work in the space through time-lapse videos. This was critical in making design choices and prioritizing features of our different mock-ups.</p>
        <p>Ideation - paper & rapid prototyping methods to experiment with different solutions. Highlights: a tool inventory website, a personal, tray-based tool storage system, workstations integrated with tool storage.</p>
