so: do we want to do this do this relationship?</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">more grad school research. lazy / should be working on work instead. need to have 10 solid projects!</span></div><div><br /></div><div>}</div><div><br /></div><div>1-23</div><div>—</div><div>LA. sitting in Cava. sandwiched between people, tuning in and out. relationship. bros having fun. and group of 3, chatting about mutual friends. lots of piercings, colored hair. observing. and of course, watching hairlines too. </div><div>yesterday at torrance. alisse shadowing doc. me, coffee shop w vibes. some space. thinking. and on ride back, initiating a positive conversation about how there is no rush w moving, and that i will no longer conflate her caring with her thinking through this. proud of myself and all. a positive convo. how alisse was frustrated with me for being sad and not telling her. made her less attracted to me (hence no sex for 3 days).</div><div>a couple days before: talking about moving. alisse worried about being my support system. overwhelmed. not sure if she’ll give what i need. agreeing, somewhat absent mindedly with this last. she cries but doesn’t want to be comforted. i guess she does care.</div><div>today: frustrated with things that are left unsaid, lingering. like how that convo was all me adapting to her once again. but: alisse’s natural tendency is to not admit she’s wrong. i need to *know what i want* *i need to call her out. the things left unsaid: how i feel disconnected sometimes and want facetime, how time with me sometimes feels like it is being weighed but not like that w med school friends. i guess that’s all. but replaying negative scenarios in my head. that’s the issue. how i’m flying out and stuff and alisse is doing nothing special. things like that. not problems. but things i would do. expecting them back.</div><div>better hangouts w phoebe this time.</div><div>regarding move:</div><ul><li><div>fantasize about sf. do not fantasize about LA.</div></li><li><div>how i think about this as long distance w my friends or long distance w my girlfriend. kind of. i guess less of a direct pull to see friends, and more of an imposition when i stay.</div></li><li><div>sf life while in relationship might not be so bad. but feeling silly that alisse wants me to inch towards her. and what about the two more years of long distance after.</div></li><li><div>the reality that long distance — with ft once per week, with often absent minded texts, will not work well for me. that maybe if she is super super set on ‘you go to sf’ i should end it.</div></li><li><div>but also living in sf might be nice. and i still like alisse and can maybe see where it goes. *but i need something*. split 50/50 visits. more facetime. more something.</div></li><li><div>she has said she definitely wants to be with me for the next year</div></li></ul><div><br /></div><div>things i need to do:</div><ul><li><div>with argument or confrontation. take accountability and apologize like you do. but: think, what do i want in this situation. advocate for myself. and ask alisse if she can provide that, or why she didn’t.</div></li></ul><div>keep getting upset with alisse for not taking my approach and being exceptionally apologetic and considerate. that’s not her and it’s never been her and it doesn’t mean she doesn’t care. *tell her what i want*. </div><div><br /></div><div>we good. things are good. so chill. do i need to bring up this: need your attention stuff? or just bring it up when i need her attention. </div><div><br /></div><div>positive things</div><ul><li><div>love yous. affection. </div></li><li><div>better time with med school friends.</div></li></ul><div><br /></div><div>damn i think about this relationship way too much. </div><div><br /></div><div>okay other things dma breakfast tomorrow thinking about that lots.</div><div><br /></div><div>la people are chill here i kinda get the vibes.</div><div><br /></div><div>stop thinking about this relationship. my goals, is all i care about. that’s all.</div><div><br /></div><div>okay that was kinda therapeutic </div><div><br /></div><div>1-21</div><div><br /></div><div>now, espresso profeta. dead laptop and no outlet. hard to wake up this morning. mini tummy ache (gone post coffee &gt; poop). </div><div>meeting with ahp in the morning. now, awaiting dma meetup w ben.</div><div><br /></div><div>some resentment maybe at alisse not massaging me as hard as i massaged her, getting sleepy and stuff.</div><div><br /></div><div>1-26</div><div><br /></div><div>nearing end of trip. in oakland now. walking around neighborhood. more gridlike, flat (bikable) than expected. much diff from SF. kinda quiet. some artsy spaces (architecture forms, galleries, snippets of conversations related to creative projects). cheap coworking space. would def live here over SF.</div><div>imagining living here. freelance sort of life. similar to that summer in brooklyn. exciting, disorienting, slightly lonely.</div><div>but now i have a partner. it doesn’t seem too change much. about this decision. maybe it should.</div><div>mental space, when alone, occupied by: imagining living in oak, la, mission. what about here. observing people and jumping to conclusions because that’s what i need to make this decision. </div><div>a series of essays on identity, about being arab american.</div><div>i guess tech is my medium because it’s accessible. crosses the sort of art stereotype that i’ve been veered away. but i can use it in unexpected way. begin to make you question lines of discipline and expectation.</div><div>okay a writing project where you have floating text detailing everything about someone.</div><div>good artist statement stuff.</div><div>back to empty space. imaginary conversations with alisse, of course. about moving. not positive. i know that giving her space is the right thing to do and sort of brings her closer. and so i will do that. practically tactically. but internally: i cannot make the move for her. when she does not want it badly. and i love her and i want to be close to her but also family. not ready for all that commitment. but the alternative is: long distance. and then grad school and likely more long distance. i guess grad school would put as at more equal footing. places in life, effort dedicated to relationship. and that’s good. but also more disconnected. likely to dissolve. i can’t end it now tho. too painful. keep exploring it. but do not commit to someone who is not committed to you.</div><div>~~snippet of imaginary conversation. since when have you been such a strong support system for me? we facetime for 30 min a week. casual texts. i do my own thing. i’ve never been clingy. but somehow it’s still stressful to have me near you...</div><div><br /></div><div>more myself here with ahmed, as compared to morocco. less passive, more animated. huh. i suppose a bit more grounded in this country,</div><div><br /></div><div>later: </div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">meeting with coco</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">colin in chilling w emma and may. how people watching, from emma's perspective, is gross. i get it. because she has been watched like an object. how to respectfully people watch?.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">his recent trips.</span></div><hr /><div><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">1-27 (sf &gt; bos)</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">--</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">airplane. forced writing. because: a little tired. mind drifting. don't want to read or watch or break the cycle (of thoughts). the cycle is comfortable. it is a space. a negative space. but one that feels comfortable and natural right now.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">mountains and water as we ascend.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">my nose piercing falling out this morning. re-installing. okay.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">morning: packing up at hersh's. shower, and some stretches. philz coffee. i like this coffee shop. vibes. nearby, lady and guy talking about some sort of community event and where to draw the line at accommodating all sorts of people.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">listening to deerhunter and imagining deerhunter lead. recalling his asexuality, awkwardness.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">cycle of thoughts. right now. all about alisse. and her commitment to me. my decision, sort of made. i like oakland. it's dope. if alisse decides that our relationship is important enough to explore, and that she wants to grow with me. then i should live in la. otherwise: oakland is better. but also otherwise: maybe end this. or talk about whether alisse wants to try to give me these things: more welcoming into med school life, more frequent communication.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">precipitated largely by 'you too! &lt;3' in response to 'i love you'. by thinking about how alisse didn't want to hook up a few times. whenever she senses negativity. i don't know maybe she wanted condensed typing. a little tipsy, maybe crossed, last night, and almost crying. no tears but maybe some wetness. hands on eyes. in bed. adding 'kinda miss u' text, not expecting anything. i mean i don't know maybe because she's sleeping and can only text from computer. but -- knowing i'll get nothing back. and. i don't know. sad. do you love me. are you having doubts about me.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">the neutral and positive things: this is not the first time alisse has said 'you too' in response when not angry with me. but: very few times. and also, has been said in response when angry with me. and like: no anger, i think, now. two i love yous right before leaving. and warmth. and overall: texts kind of positive. calling me boop and stuff. saying i look good. i don't know.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">anyway. she needs space. give her space. also saying 'wish i can scoop granola into u'. weird and cute. should have made granola for u. 'you are a yummer'. and lots of affection before trip. and like during too. i don't know.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">cycles:</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">how you feel about me:</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">- 'you expect me to be positive, and trusting. and only bring that energy. but you don't give me what i need to feel that way.'</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">relationship comparisons: </span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">- listening to james blakes' new album about love - how his partner sacrifices for him and everything. comparing to this relationship and like wha what am i getting. </span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">- and then also: rosa (ruba's friend). how her bf comes 2x/month. she wants him to move, but understands job and stuff. how he kind of only need your partner. how she's committed to hers. stuff like that.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">- how you text phoebe all the time but not me. </span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">how i can't imagine you doing much for me. </span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">- like when you considered throwing away my suitcase -- maybe because under the impression that it's broken (can choose for this to be the focus, and be positive). like okay a nuisance. but i brought it because of *your stuff*. how you're reluctant to bring it to nyc. and also how there's a mattress in your room that you don't mind storying.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">- what if i moved? can i throw my stuff at your place. can i stay with you until i figure it out? would you be okay with it? </span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">how now, on the plane</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">(doing the thing where love from a few days ago, a few weeks ago, is invalid now. even tho nothing concrete happened)</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">--</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">tactically, practically:</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">again, summarize. my approach to this decision is made. if: alisse feels overwhelmed, if both of us decide this relationship is still in an 'exploratory' phase. then oakland. because i like oakland better. perks of la (diversity, weather sort of) with walkability of sf. freelance community. am i open to moving to LA after oakland for a while? 'try it out'. taking a step back after moving to LA seems like -- no going back.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">remember doubts about family. and about her: that she doesn't give me enough communication, intimacy, cannot take criticism. has never really adapted to what i want. how she treats me when angry with me. our way of handling conflicts: and how i am overly empathetic. do not advocate for myself. you do not advocate for me. this is bad for my mental health.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">to me this decision comes down to: how much do we value this relationship.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">i guess, positively, she needs to know</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">&gt;&gt; how to handle myself until we have this conversation. like. don't bring it up. don't tell her about oakland. or do? because it's a process. but just like objectively. i guess saying i like it = her feeling more pressure for keeping me away from that.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">--</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">my hair is poofier and better now. will look better longer.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">-- </span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">should i make a list of positive things now?</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">okay. we're getting relationship piercings. alisse excited about that. lots of hand holding. kisses. i love you. hearts in the morning. i don't want you to leave today. it's too early.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">i guess it's a possibility that she doesn't want to hear about how great my time was at the bay. unlikely tho. cannot imagine.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">how alisse cried when i indicated she might not be able to give me what i need.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">how it was a lot better with alisse's friends. not necessarily because she went out of her way to make me welcome. but i guess not feeling as weird as around me. dancing w her at the mini party. how she showed innana and emma pictures of my travels. innana knew about my hair. how: innana is excited for me to be away (jokingly) because more time with alisse.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">how alisse wants to go to coachella with me</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">-</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">intellectual questions about love.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">- would extreme love always manifest in wanting to talk to me more? over long distance. or could you simultaneously love, be busy, and not want to talk.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">- when to make the decision on where something is going..i don't know</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">--</span></div><div><br /></div><hr /><div>1-31 post la</div><div><br /></div><div>dripping </div><div><br /></div><div>today in therapy like feeling progress and life going places. exploring. wanting to explore this relationship.</div></en-note>]]></content><created>20190121T015311Z</created><updated>20190407T180318Z</updated><note-attributes><reminder-order>0</reminder-order></note-attributes></note>

because you didn’t. and me like: okay, we shouldn’t be so mean to each other. and asking her to imagine me being there. and how: it’s disappointing if it doesn’t happen. and so i start imagining things. get her to think like me. me massaging her and making her dinner during busy exam time.</div><div>picking up on wednesday, before leaving. baldwin hill. drive to the top. and talk. about other things, then relationship. not that much to say. concern about not having community. dry for words. alisse. timelines. where would you be after grad school? uh, i don’t know? some big city. alisse wants to stay in california (surprised at plan, so far ahead).</div><div>she really loves me.</div><div>a cute and gooey dinner, food adventure. then ice cream. super full. home for 30 min before flight. good sex, goodbye.</div><div>can i imagine dating someone else? maybe. is the one? i don’t know. but i know a lot about her already.</div><div>me saying ‘we’ve done a year of long distance and still going strong’ - and alisse a comment about how we’re still in love.</div><div><br /></div><div>the invisibilia episode about empathy and how sometimes it might be appropriate to hold back, not give someone empathy</div><div><br /></div><div>seto sick. doctors thinking heart failure.</div><div><br /></div><div>vision. good now, in the humidity.</div><div><br /></div><div>i am beautiful i think</div><div><br /></div></en-note>]]></content><created>20190420T004208Z</created><updated>20190427T031832Z</updated><note-attributes><author>omarwnema@gmail.com</author><source>desktop.mac</source><reminder-order>0</reminder-order></note-attributes></note>
