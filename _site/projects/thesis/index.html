                A collaboration with Radu Darie in the Borton Neuromotion Laboratory at Brown University. We created a tool to predict movement from spinal cord stimulation in primates. The project was thoroughly documented to allow for continuous development, and the Borton laboratory has continued to  build on the project.

        <p>Current treatment - Epidural Electrical Stimulation (EES) of the spinal cord has shown to improve motor control in humans and animals with spinal cord injury. Really - zapping the spinal cord can actually induce controlled movement.

        The end goal of EES research is to develop a closed-loop system where neural implants can translate intention to move -&gt; electrical stimulation -&gt; actual movement. (layered: Closed loop systems currently exist, but can only show simple constrained movement.)

        A computational model (which I aim to construct) will enable greater accuracy and efficiency in motor stimulation, and create a framework for understanding spinal cord stimulation. This model will be continually fine-tuned as more epidural electrode stimulation studies are conducted, and can help pave development for spinal neuroprosthetic systems.

        We used three pieces of software to create a hybrid model to identify circuits and activity recruited by EES (layered: Current software can be used to create physics simulations, or neural simulations, but not both.) After developing and validating a functional hybrid model, we worked to make our model modular and scalable.

We used images and dimensions of histological spinal cord slices as a blueprint for rendering a biologically-accurate spinal cord. Conductivity values were assigned to different layers of the spinal cord to ensure that it could emulate a real stimulation experiment. Note that this model is simply a volume conductor - and does not actually have any neurons! Neurons were later superimposed onto the model (hybrid model section). </p>

        We tested our model by running simulations, and, simply, doing the math. Each 3D spinal cord component to be imported into COMSOL, a physics simulator,  as a volume conductor. Our electrode, approximated as a surface current source, was placed in the epidural space to imitate EES experiments. <br /><br />
        Mathematically, our model fit predictions (layered: The graph bears a 1/r relationship, as expected. Voltage along the line bears a relationship that resembles Maxwell’s equations. Given that current and conductivity (equation 1) are constant, distance from the source is responsible for the relationship in Figure 4. At the top center of the graph (dark area), the distance to the point source is lowest, and voltage is at a maximum). Anatomically, we saw the same patterns that were demonstrated in real experiments (layered: the highest concentration of current in the epidural space, with a large voltage drop-off in the CSF, and some current carried over into the dura).

        <p>We wrote code in .hoc (NEURON scripting language) (layered: fascinating to instantiate objects of neural networks with pure text!) to construct biophysical models of Ia fibers and motor neurons, according to physical constraints. Afferent fiber and motor neuron geometry was extracted from cat neuron shape in the digital neuron database at NeuroMorpho.org.

         <p>Validation - in line with experimental procedures, the electrical stimulation is visualized as a square wave pulse. Additionally, plots of Ia axon and motor neuron display the typical signature of an action potential – threshold, depolarization, repolarization, and refractory period. The motor neuron, pictured in orange, is recruited after the Ia fiber, which is expected given that the motor neuron is stimulated indirectly. At low stimulation values (200 mA and less), neither the Ia axon, nor the motor display peaks, as expected.</p>

        <p>Our model (like previous computational models in literature) was built under the assumption that the number of motor axons recruited is proportional to a motor potential produced by an EES stimulus [Capogrosso]. This assumption entails that the recruitment curve – a plot of neuron firing as a result of stimulation – is a valid metric for evaluating model efficacy. 
        <br /><br /> 
        The recruitment curve (action potential generation at different voltage values) below shows the same sigmoidal shape that is described in literature studies using the same diameter distribution. A superficial analysis of this curve reveals typical characteristics of a recruitment curve (layered: a flat-line preceding a certain threshold voltage, a positive slope where fibers start to reach threshold and elicit action potentials, and a peak value where all fibers are recruited [Capogrosso, Vleggert-Lankamp].) The slope of this sigmoid shape is a result of our diameter distribution — larger diameter fibers are the first to be recruited, and smaller fibers are gradually recruited afterwards. Intuitively then, these results match a typical biophysical response to epidural stimulation.
