title: narrative<br>research
time: summer 2014
heading: As part of my internship with Charles River Analytics, I worked on SONNET - a project that attempts to merge narrative research in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and marketing in order to create useful predictions and suggestions for writers. I was asked to develop a framework for quantifying narrative attributes.

        <li>Maximize space - in the crowded workshop</li>

        Space distribution  - rather than working near one tool wall in the crammed workshop, our Y-shape allows students to spread out, and distribute space more efficiently.

        <span class="highlight">Flexibility<span class="tooltip"><img src="/assets/img-tools/tools-real.jpeg" class="block-image block-image-small"></span></span>  - We used a combination of fixed and movable tool tool racks. High-demand (low-supply) tools are fixed to the wall, but common tools can be pulled used the cart.

Tool holders, were designed in SolidWorks, laser cut from sheet aluminum, and attached with (hand-tightened) thumb screws through slots in each panel that align with the 80/20 skeleton inside.
