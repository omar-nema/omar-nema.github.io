title: narrative<br>research
time: summer 2014
heading: As part of my internship with Charles River Analytics, I worked on SONNET - a project that attempts to merge narrative research in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and marketing in order to create useful predictions and suggestions for writers. I was asked to develop a framework for quantifying narrative attributes. Collaboration with Benjamin Bauchwitz (MIT '15).

    By aggregating research, Charles River Analytics hopes to develop conceptual links between research from disparate fields. Once this research bank is robust enough, users — the users here being story-writers, or marketers — can input their desired response from a narrative, and receive suggestions from different research studies. (A user looking to induce, say, empathy in their audience, may receive a suggestion to include a certain type of character revelation.) In addition to receiving writing suggestions, a writer can also work backwards — that is, test the physiological and psychological, responses to narratives in a user, and see what kind of responses the user is producing. 
Rather than relying on subjective measures like surveys, researchers can quantify psychological responses to narratives using this tool.
