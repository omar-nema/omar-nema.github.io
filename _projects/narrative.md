title: narrative<br>research
time: summer 2014
heading: As part of my internship with Charles River Analytics, I worked on SONNET - a project that attempts to merge narrative research in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and marketing in order to create useful predictions and suggestions for writers. I was asked to develop a framework for quantifying narrative attributes. Collaborated with Benjamin Bauchwitz (MIT '15).
