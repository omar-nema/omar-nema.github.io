          Each floating thought is a snippet from my journal. Clicking on an individual thought will bring it into focus, alongside surrounding text from the linked journal entry, and the 'thought pattern' it is associated with.

          The viewer can sift through a canvas of thoughts in the default &rsquo;split&rsquo; view on desktop, and &rsquo;flat&rsquo; view on mobile. Opting to &rsquo;sort&rsquo; thoughts allows the viewer to delve into thoughts within the context of a pattern.

            Sifting through journal (inspiration)

          <div class="desc-content">
            I have been journaling for a few years now. Writing for me is usually an exercise in clearing out my brain, in spilling out thoughts lingering in my head.
            <br><br>
            After years of journaling, I revisited my entries. Common threads emerged between entries. Externally, these threads often manifest as self-defined personality traits. When I explain an opinion, belief, or idea, I am explaining the culmination of a thread of thoughts -- I am communicating a thought pattern. Individual thoughts within the pattern do not hold enough weight, or coherence to share with others.
            <br><br>
            And so these fragments linger. On paper, and in my brain. Re-reading my journal entries sparked a deep curiousity in communicating &rsquo;raw&rsquo; thoughts (inspiring to this project), and in eliciting some of the same thought fragments from others (inspiring another project: Blackbox).

            Twitter as a medium
          </h3>
          <div class="desc-content">
            I took to twitter to express these thought fragments. Twitter as a medium seemed fitting: its viewers are accustomed to fragmented writing (a result of the character limit, and disjointed news feed). I created a handle -- 'brain__spill' -- and posted a random sampling of thought fragments from my journal -- sometimes with a corresponding thought pattern as a label.
            <br><br>
            The result was unsatisfying (owing partly, perhaps, to my single-digit follower count). The content was too static. To the viewer, fragmented thoughts would appear on a news feed, decontextualized & cryptic. Adding additonal context alongside the thought (like a thought pattern label) prompted the user to contextualize too quickly. <br><br> There was no opportunity for patterns to emerge. An exploratory element was missing.
