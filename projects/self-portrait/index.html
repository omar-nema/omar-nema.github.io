          &rsquo;Floating Thoughts&rsquo; is an exploration in non-narrative communication.
          <br><br>
          The visual invites the viewer to construct and deconstruct a narrative of the self. From thought pattern to thought fragment. 'Floating Thoughts' visualizes a set of journal snippets. The fragments can be viewed in isolation or in the context of self-categorized thought patterns. The viewer is thus able to contrast the narratives they draw from individual fragments with the patterns that I, the storyteller, have outlined.

          'Floating Thoughts' visualized a set of journal snippets. Clicking on an individual fragment will bring it into focus, along with surrounding text from the linked journal entry, and the self-categorized pattern it is associated with.
          <br><br>
           The fragments can be viewed in isolation ('split' layout), in the context of self-categorized patterns ('sort' layout), or completely flattened, where the end of one fragment marks the beginning of another.

            Journaling, for me, is an exercise in clearing out my mental space, in spilling out thoughts that linger and externalizing them on some medium, whether analog or digital. It is the closest approximation I have to a non-narrativized self - one that is vulnerable, open, and unconcerned with judgment.
            <br><br>
            After years of journaling, I revisited my entries. Common threads emerged between entries. Externally, these threads often manifest as self-defined personality traits. When I explain an opinion, belief, or idea, I am explaining the culmination of a thread of thoughts. Individual thoughts within the pattern do not hold enough weight, or coherence to share with others.
            <br><br>
            And so these fragments linger. On paper, in my brain. Re-reading my journal entries sparked a deep curiosity in communicating these raw fragments, and exploring the disparity between the narrative we tell others, and who we are.

            Twitter as a medium
          </h3>
          <div class="desc-content">
            Initially, I took to twitter to express these thought fragments. Twitter as a medium seemed fitting: its viewers are accustomed to fragmented writing (a result of the character limit, and disjointed news feed). I created a handle -- 'brain__spill' -- and posted a random <span class=" clickable-span twitter-one">sampling of thought fragments</span> from my journal -- sometimes <span class="clickable-span twitter-two">with a corresponding thought pattern as a label.</span>
            <br><br>
            The result was unsatisfying (owing partly to my single-digit follower count). The content was too static. To the viewer, fragmented thoughts would appear on a news feed, decontextualized & cryptic. Additonal categorization conveyed with the thought (like a pattern label) prompted the user to contextualize too quickly. <br><br> There was no opportunity for patterns to emerge. An exploratory element was missing.

          <h3>Code as a (better) medium</h3>
          <div class="desc-content">
            Roughly two years after the initial twitter posts (in which time I built design & development skills), I revisited the project from a design lens. After converting journal entries into <span class="clickable-span code-photo-one">structured data</span>, I created a <span class="clickable-span code-photo-three">canvas of thoughts</span>. I then built a <span class="clickable-span code-photo-two">list</span> layout to picture how the thoughts might come together.<br><br> With these two layouts as my foundation, I iterated -- refining visual choices, adding interactive elements (draggability, transitions, animations), and a mobile-friendly 'flat' thought layout. See code <span class="clickable-span" href="https://github.com/omar-nema/omar-nema.github.io/blob/master/scripts/thought-parser.js">here</span>.

          This project is of one of two pieces exploring mediated self-expression. The other - '<a href="../../projects/me.txt/" target="_blank">Thought Parser</a>' - similarly displays segments of my journal. In 'Thought Parser', the form and content is dynamic, and driven by an algorithm. The narrative in 'Thought Parser' emerges from patterns detected by code.
          <br><br>
          Juxtaposed, these two pieces question the process of developing narratives. The information we share with others - in telling our own stories - is structured. Both algorithm and human undergo similar processes of categorization. Yet so much meaning lies in the individual experiences and data that we do not share. These pieces thus break the narrative apart into individual elements, and invite the viewer to question human bias in constructing stories.
